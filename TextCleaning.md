# Notes 
- Will need to do a close reading of both texts 
- Would like to table words used in both documents (i.e. Negro, white, Condefederate/Confederacy, grateful/ungrateful, South) to find narratives of "the happy slave" and other Lost Cause myths used in textbooks. 
- Found extra textbooks that can be added to website/work later.
