# Reconscruction Pedagogy Project 
Project researching The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) Constitution and other documents for pedagogical policies perpetuating Lost Cause propaganda during Reconstruction.
## Purpose 
This website will be a repository for the beginning of my thesis about Reconstruction pedagogy. My thesis will look at textbooks published in the early 20th century while also looking at policy and documentation from The United Daughters of the Confederacy. My goal will be to find policy in UDC's documents and align them with the textbooks used in the 20th century. Eventually I will begin to look for Lost Cause mythology in those textbooks and in UDC policy. I would like to look at states education policies during the 20th century to see how history and Reconstruction was discussed and taught. The documents include the meeting minutes, convention notes and UDC's constitution.
