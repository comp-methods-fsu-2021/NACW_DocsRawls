# Reconscruction Pedagogy Project 
Project researching The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) Constitution and other documents for pedagogical policies perpetuating Lost Cause propaganda during Reconstruction.
## Purpose 
This website will be a repository for the beginning of my thesis about Reconstruction pedagogy. My thesis will look at textbooks published in the early 20th century while also looking at policy and documentation from The United Daughters of the Confederacy. My goal will be to find policy in UDC's documents and align them with the textbooks used in the 20th century. Eventually I will begin to look for Lost Cause mythology in those textbooks and in UDC policy. I would like to look at states education policies during the 20th century to see how history and Reconstruction was discussed and taught. The documents include the meeting minutes, convention notes and UDC's constitution.

- January 30, 2021: Using the database History Vault to find documents.

- February 15, 2021: Meeting with DH Librarian Sarah Stanley to help understanding tabular data, downloaded OpenRefined, made table. 
- February 16, 2021: Met with DH Librarian Sarah Stanley and Will Hanley to discuss project, progression. Need to find more textbooks. Updated metadata about Through some eventful years in OpenRefine/Breve and made very simple tables to play around with digital tools.

- February 23, 2021: Cleaning up meeting minutes text and trying to make a table (exercise 5) in OpenRefine, but so far unsuccessful. I think I'll have more luck with it comes to text mining, especially if I'm able to upload the additional textbooks I found. 
- February 28, 2021: Began playing around with website building and tried to build a website using The Programming Historian 'Build a Static Site' page with no luck. Began building a Google site page, unpublished and cannot share.
