# Reconscruction Pedagogy Project 
## Purpose 
This website will be a repository for the beginning of my thesis about Reconstruction pedagogy. My thesis will look at different textbooks used in middle school history/social studies classes, from across different states and compare them. I'll also look at documents from the Lost Cause narrative that was driven in part by The United Daughters of the Confederacy. While look at the papers of The UDC, I'll also look at the papers of The National Association of Colored Women papers to see if they have any pedagogical influence on schools where Black children were taught.
