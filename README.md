others must have their credentials before they could be rec- 
ognized. A short discussion concerning the matter develop.

pointments until the Association was opened in proper form.

she believed that ability depended neither upon race nor 
upon sex. She advised work for legislation, saying the time 
would soon be when the two races would work together, as 
one of us cannot get along without the other. She warned

advised all to work for the common needs. Miss Farson,

       prepared and well read, are feeble words. Mrs. Ida J. Jackson

       sion by reading a paper. It was a masterly production, and, 
       like others, was heartily applauded. Mrs. Lucy E. Phillips

suggested to better tit us for the ordeal and solemnize our 
hearts, five prayers be offered in five minutes, which was 
accordingly done and while a feeling of solemnity pervaded 
the house, the following names were placed in nomination 
for President Mesdames Bruce, Washington, Ruffin, Yates, 
Thurman and Terrell. It had been fully understood that as 
the present President had served but one term since the law 
of two terms had gone into effect, she was eligible to a re- 
election. Sitich discussion was indulged in on all subjects 
pertaining to balloting, and after much time had been c.• 
sinned, on motion of Sirs. Anthony those who desired to do 
so were told they might withdraw their names. After more 
thought and discussion their names were continued and the 
balloting begun. Sirs. Ruffin moved that as the name of each 
delegate was called, she should come forward and deposit 
her vote on the table in front of the Convention. Motion 
carried. The balloting was quietly conducted and resulted 
in the re-election of Mrs_ Mary Church Terrell as President 
for the ensuing term, she receiving ioO votes of the i44 
cast on the first ballot. The hour being far past noon Sirs. 
Bruce moved that we adjourn to lunch and rest until 
P. Si, Motion was unanimously carried. Lunch had been 
prepared by the ladies of the church as usual.

  At    NI., the President sounded the gavel and the 
Convention was reassembled. Sirs. Bruce read greetings 
from Sirs. Rosetta E. Lawson. of Washington. D. C. A tele- 
gram from Sirs. Julia Hooks concerning little Lucy Russell,

cers be as they then stood. 1. motion was lost and 
the regular way of voting was the order. The following names 
were placed in nomination for First Vice President: Me,

               16
dames Ruffin, Anthony and Bruce. Mesdames Ruffin and 
Anthony withdrew. Mrs. Moody moved the rules be sus- 
pended and Mrs. Bruce be elected by acclamation. Motion 
elrried. Second Vice Presidents were nominated as fol• 
lows: Mesdames Coleman of Nebraska. Thurman and Mrs.

didates Mrs. Thurman withdrew and Mrs. Lucy E. Phillips. 
of Jackson, Tenn., was declared elected. The following 
names were placed in nomination for Corresponding Sec- 
retary: Miss Mary Lynch, of N. C., Mrs. Fannie 13. Williams, 
of Chicago, Miss Anna V. Thompkins of Washington. D. C. 
Miss Mary Lynch was elected. Most of the afternoon was 
spent in electing a Recording Secretary. Since it is always 
necessary to appoint two assistants to the Recording Secre• 
tart', it was deemed wise to elect three recording secretaries 
instead of one. The following names were balloted upon 
with the following result: Mrs. C. A. Curl of Chicago, Miss 
L. C. Carter of ,ew Bedford, Mass., Mrs. Sutton of Pittsburg. 
First elected was Mrs. C. A. Curl, who received too votes,

pended and Mrs. Silo. Yates was unanimously re-elected 
Treasurer. By acclamation and on motion of Mrs. L. A. 
Davis, Mrs. Jeffries, National Organizer was re•elected in the 
same way. Mrs. Bruce nominated Mrs. Booker T. Wash• 
ington as Chairman of the Executive Committee. She was 
also elected unanimously by acclamation. During the after- 
noon Mrs. Louie Jackson of Bay City took every imprint, 
nity to impress upon all the necessity of subscribing for the 
official organ of the Association. The notes $tS.00 in sub- 
scription was secured. Many of the books offered by Mrs. 
Terrell for sale in interest of a Kindergarten were sold; $38 
was realized. Rev. and Mrs. Carey were called for to come 
forward that they might receive the thanks of the Association
