# Reconscruction Pedagogy Project 
## Purpose 
This website will be a repository for the beginning of my thesis about Reconstruction pedagogy. My thesis will look at current (published in the last 20 years) textbooks used in middle school history/social studies classes from across different states and compare them. I'll also look at documents from the Lost Cause narrative that was driven in part by The United Daughters of the Confederacy. The documents include the meeting minutes, convention notes and UDC's constitution. While looking at the papers of UDC, I'll also look at the papers of The National Association of Colored Women papers to see if they have any pedagogical influence on schools where Black children were taught.
## Documents 
- National Association of Colored Women Second Convention 
- The United Daughters of the Confederacy Constitution
