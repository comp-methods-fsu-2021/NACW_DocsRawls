THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED 
 
 Chapter Presidents are requested to note especially: 
 
 Chapter Presidents will remember that all taxes, both State and 
 General, must be paid to the State Treasurer before votes can be 
 counted in Convention. These taxes must be paid before September 
 1 or votes are lost. State taxes are now 15 cents, and General taxes 
 10 cencs, making 25 cents to be sent for each member to the State 
 Treasury. At the same time send $1.00 for each Chapter to Sinking 
 Fund. 
 
 Money must be sent by Postoffi.ce Money Order only. 
 
 All members must be registered to vote them. 
 
 All Chapter Registrars must by September 15th of each year send 
 a correct list of members to the State Registrar. 
 
 All money, for any and all causes, must be sent to Mrs. J. W. Pless, 
 State Treasurer, Marion, not to Chairmen of Committees or private 
 Individuals. State for what causes. 
 
 All Chapters are required to give U. D. C. engraved certificates to 
 each member. Cost 15 cents each. Presidents are urged to attend 
 to this. 
 
 All Chapter elections must be held at regular or called meetings in 
 November. This is very important, to get correct list in Minutes, 
 both General and State. 
 
 Do not fail to notify Mrs. J. F. Hayden, President of the High Point 
 Chapter, High Point, N. C, by September 15th how many delegates 
 will attend the Convention. 
 
 All orders for U. D. C. badges must in future be sent to Mrs. C. M. 
 Roberts, Hot Springs, Ark. 
 
 Printed permits may be obtained from her or your State Presi- 
 dent; these must be used in ordering. All orders will be returned to 
 the Chapter President. No individual orders filled nor sample cuts 
 sent. 
 
 Prices without bar, $3.75 each; with bar, $4.50. No checks will be 
 accepted, only money orders. Those wishing the badges registered 
 should include ten cents for registry fee. 
 
 When desiring information regarding the Soldiers' Home, write 
 Mrs. Charles Lee Smith, Raleigh, N. C. When desiring information 
 regarding the Confederate Women's Home, write Mrs. Hunter G. 
 Smith, Fayetteville. 
 
 District meetings will be held in the spring. All leaders are urged 
 to hold these invaluable meetings and reports should be sent at once 
 to the State President. 
 
 Please publish lists of scholarships in local papers. Send in appli- 
 cations for scholarships to Miss Annie Gash, Pisgah Forest, Chairman 
 of Education, before May 1st, and reports of scholarships and medals 
 given before June 15th. North Carolina adopted the official U. D. C. 
 medal. This is to be obtained from Mrs. C. M. Roberts, Hot Springs, 
 Ark. 
 
 A resolution was passed by the General Convention "that each 
 Chapter subscribe to the Yeteran for one or more subscriptions and 
 try and place it in schools and public libraries."

 Then followed a discussion as to which President was 
 entitled to cast the vote— the President for the year 1917-1918 
 or the new President for the year 1918-1919. It was decided 
 that if the President for the year 1917-1918 was present, she 
 would be entitled to cast the vote as President, but if she were 
 not present that the vote could be cast by the new President. 
 Each Chapter was entitled to have one President cast the vote.

 PRESIDENT'S REPORT 
 
 Madam President General of the United Daughters of the Confed- 
 eracy and Members of the North Carolina Division in Conven- 
 tion Assembled: 
 
 In order not to take too much of your time and space in the min- 
 utes, your President has decided not to give an outlined report of 
 work accomplished during the second term of her administration, but 
 to leave it for you to judge from the report of the chairmen of 
 the different committees just what the North Carolina Division 
 United Daughters of the Confederacy has done along all lines. It 
 is a source of gratification to know the Daughters of the Confed- 
 eracy continued their great work coupled with that they were called 
 upon to do during the great crisis. 
 
 Today the subject touched upon will not be commemorating the 
 heroic deeds of the soldiers of the sixties alone, but the bring- 
 ing to you a message from the great War Relief work. "We saw 
 the whole world discordant and beligerent Europe representing 
 a vast battlefield and harvest of death. We saw our bravest and 
 best climbing a new Calvary. On the one side a mighty force 
 with a ruthless ambition, on the other a combination of Chris- 
 tian powers ready to seal their devotion to justice and right- 
 eousness by their hearts' best blood. Did the Daughters of the 
 Confederacy answer the call? Yes, a thousand times yes, as proven 
 by the action of our splendid President General, Miss Mary B. Poeh 
 penheim, whose proud privilege is ours to have with us during this 
 Convention to council and advise us. Realizing that the Daughters 
 were eager to prove themselves worthy of their mothers of the six- 
 ties, she created a Committee of Seven, The War Relief Committee, 
 with your own North Carolina President a member. What greater 
 honor could come; to feel that the head of such a magnificent organi- 
 zation should deem one worthy of having a part in this glorious 
 work. 
 
 The first work of this committee was to ask each State to endow 
 a bed in a ward in the American Military Hospital at Nueilly, 
 France. It was a glorious undertaking, splendidly planned and 
 executed, carrying to the boys at the front the wonderful spirit of 
 the Confederacy. How well did you respond to this work? By mak- 
 ing the best War Relief report of any State at the General Convention 
 in Louisville. From your State Director's report you nobly did your 
 part. Think of the splendid work you did along all lines. All over 
 the State you were working for, praying for, if need be would have 
 sacrificed for these boys. You were not called upon for service 
 alone but to aid your Government to finance this great war by sub- 
 scribing to Liberty Bonds, War Savings Stamps and by aiding the 
 Red Cross and all other activities. When you receive your General

18 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 Minutes of the LfOuisville Convention do not fail to read your Presi- 
 dent General's report, giving especially the Chapters work accom- 
 plished by the division under the "War Relief Work Committee." 
 
 Your Registrar's report shows 331 new members registered in 
 North Carolina, with ten demitted to the State. This being the larg- 
 est new membership registered in the division during the year. 
 Two hundred and sixty-six certificates were issued by the Recording 
 Secretary General, of which number Mrs. Merchant said: "I con- 
 gratulate you on that goodly number, so many states have fallen 
 back this year, due to the war, I suppose." Three new Chapters 
 have been organized — one at Spring Hope by Mrs. Walter Woodard 
 — one at Asheville and one at Middlesex. 
 
 A motion at both the General and State Conventions of 1917 gave 
 our Veterans and Educational work only in conjunction with that of 
 the Great War. Twice during the month of January it was your 
 President's pleasure and honor to appear before the Legislature in 
 behalf of Increased Pensions for our dear old men. While we did 
 not obtain just as much as we most desired for them — and it seems 
 a pity too — for if North Carolina owes her Veterans anything it 
 owes them sufficient means that their last days may be passed in 
 ease and comfort. Still it is gratifying that our efforts were not 
 in vain as there was an increase on a basis of $15.00 for each grade. 
 Let us continue to work for Increased Pensions. Soon it will be 
 beyond the power of the State Legislature to aid these men that 
 dared all, sacrificed all and died — 
 
 "Their's not to reason why 
 Their's but to do and die." 
 
 There was an increased appropriation for the Soldier's Home and 
 the Confederate Women's Home; also the continued appropriation 
 for the next two years of $200 annually for the North Carolina Room 
 in the Museum in Richmond. With pride we are able to report the 
 first and only State to finish its endowment fund for this work. If 
 your President has accomplished nothing more during the time she 
 has served you this alone has been her reward; that twice during 
 her administration the Legislature has seen fit to listen to the plea 
 from the Daughters of the Confederacy for increased pensions for 
 the Confederate Veterans and their widows. It was in the power of 
 your representatives that the last days of the living of these heroes 
 should be more comfortable and they were not unmindful of them. 
 To Messrs. George Holderness of Tarboro and McCoin of Henderson 
 as Chairman of the Appropriations Committees your President sug- 
 gests that a resolution of thanks be sent by this division. 
 
 An endowment fund of $50,000, known as the Educational Endow- 
 ment Fund, has been established by the General Division. How you 
 have contributed to this fund, your educational chairman will report. 
 


## p. 19 (#23) ##############################################

 How much you are expected to contribute will be placed before you 
 by your Director of War Relief and your Educational Chairman. Do 
 not let this great opportunity pass to prepare plans for the boys and 
 girls of today to aid them in their life work in the future reconstruc- 
 tion days. The General Division has decided the endowment fund to 
 be a memorial to the men and women of the South who served in the 
 great World War, known by the name of "The 1917-1918 Hero Fund." 
 "To honor the men and women of the South who served their 
 reunited country." It was decided at the CJeneral Convention that 
 all funds in hand for War Relief Hospital Endowment Fund be 
 transferred to your Educational Endowment Fund. 
 
 All Chapters should encourage the organization of Children's 
 Chapters, also give their best interests to those already in existence. 
 For only in our children does our future lie. We must provide for 
 the education of the child of today, who will be the man of tomorrow. 
 As you look upon the flags and banners upon this rostrum, you will 
 notice that you won two of them at the General Convention at Chatta- 
 nooga last year, the Raines Banner for the best Historical Work, 
 and the Ricks Banner for the best Children's Work. Nor is this 
 all — you won both of these banners again this year at Louisville. 
 How your President's heart beat with joy and pride when she 
 accepted them again in your behalf; you have set the standard, see 
 that you do not lower it. 
 
 At the Gastonia Convention a resolution was passed "that the 
 U. D. C. suggest to the State Historical Commission the propriety of 
 the marking the places in the "Valley of Virginia, near Winchester, 
 where Generals Fettigrew and Ramseur died." Now this resolution 
 was carried out and will be shown you during this Convention, when 
 the two beautiful bronze tablets will be unveiled, the work jointly 
 of the Historical Commission and the North Carolina Divisi'^n cS. 
 the U. D. C. It is your happy privilege to see accomplished a lovely 
 and most fitting work begun by you last year, the painting of the 
 portrait of one of your best beloved Daughters, Mrs. Hunter Smith. 
 A token to her of your appreciation of her work, to be hung on the 
 walls made possible by the untiring interest and zeal, those of the 
 Confederate Women's Home. 
 
 The Hall of History will also be enriched this year by a portrait 
 of one of the Bethel Heroes, Gen. R. H. Ricks, who has done so much 
 for the true history of the War between the States. This portrait is 
 the gift to the State by the Junior Bethel Heroes Chapter of Rocky 
 Mount. 
 
 A pause and a moment of sorrow when the Jefferson Davis monu- 
 ment was accomplished and General Bennett H. Young answered 
 the last roll-call before he saw his greatest work finished. Daugh- 
 ters, we must not fail in carrying on this work, for will it not be 
 now a monument to both to stand forever as a tribute to our best

 Southern valor. One-half century (and more) has rolled away since 
 the bright star of the Confederacy "paled to a close." Although the 
 South was left in the stranded fragments of the great War between 
 the States, her honor was unsullied, and the Daughters of the Con- 
 federacy must see to it, more than ever before, that the names and 
 fame of their heroes shall never be forgotten. When they look upon 
 the faces of the remaining of their knightly chieftains, may they 
 realize that when these men sheathed their swords, the foundations 
 were laid anew for a Reunited Republic to loom up to horizon of this 
 earth to the admiration of all the world. 
 
 Your President would indeed be more than remiss should she not 
 attempt in her feeble way to thank you, to express to you how much 
 she appreciates your continued love, loyalty and support. In her 
 own words recorded in the Minutes of the Nineteen-Fifteen Conven- 
 tion, when she had the honor of being your Recording Secretary, 
 can she best express her feelings: "Her greatest gratification is in 
 thinking her work has given you satisfaction. Her reward — those 
 friends, true and tried, that she has found and held during the time 
 she has served you. Her only request that you give her successor 
 all the support that you have given her. Then indeed her work 
 will not have been in vain." 
 
 Do you realize what a wonderful work you have accomplished? 
 Listen to the result as reported in Louisville. You won the Raines 
 Banner for best Historical Work, and Ricks Banner for best Chil- 
 dren's Work during the past two years. No other state can claim 
 such honor. You registered the greatest number of new members. 
 Tied with South Carolina in Education honors. Had the best Relief 
 Work report. Was the only State that has completed its Endow- 
 ment Fund for Room in Richmond, and in every way won applause 
 for your splendid work. How feeble are words to express to you 
 your President's highest appreciation of your work and interest. To 
 the Executive Board she owes all gratitude for its support, wise 
 counselling and complete harmony in its decisions. The best of all 
 she adds is that during the dark days of your troubled land she has 
 given that satisfaction that not one word of dissension, one unpleas- 
 ant look has been hers from you. Her rulings during her entire 
 administration have been acquiesced so unhesitatingly when often it 
 meant sacrifice to you. Glorious to feel you have been "weighed 
 and not found wanting." 
 
 To the Veterans she must also extend her warmest appreciation. 
 In addition to words of praise and commendation from those whom 
 she has ever delighted to serve, they have proven their confidence in 
 her work by honoring her with their highest official gifts at their 
 Reunion in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Gen. James I. Metts, Commander of 
 the North Carolina Veterans having appointed her Matron of Honor 
 for the State and General Julian S. Carr, sponsor for the Army of 
 Northern Virginia of which he was commander.

 In conclusion, with a heart glowing full of love for you and pride 
 for the noble work in which you are engaged, your President lays 
 down the gavel. To you, her associates for so long, she cannot say 
 farewell, but in the language of the poet: 
 
 Life we've seen long together 
 Through pleasant and through cloudy weather 
 'Tis hard to part, when friends are dear 
 Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh or tear. 
 Then steal away. Give little warning 
 Choose thine own time, say not Good Night 
 But in some fairer, brighter clime 
 Bid me Good Morning. 
 
 Faithfully submitted,

 Honorable mention was made by tbe President of the work 
 of Miss Annie Jean Gash, Chairman of Education, Miss Ameda 
 Moses of South Carolina and Mrs. K. P. Holt, Chairman of

 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that Mrs. Thrash's report be 
 accepted and that she be given a rising vote of thanks for her 
 excellent report.

 RECORDING SECRETARY'S REPORT 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 Since those bright fall days of October, 1917, in Kinston (where 
 we last met), we have felt to the fullest the sorrows, sacrifices, and 
 glories of war and have known the thrill of its ending. We have 
 seen the grim pestilence of influenza stalk through our fair land, 
 laying low with its deadly touch many a dear one. Though the war 
 and pestilence, dear daughters, have brought you your full share of 
 sorrow and work, undaunted you have met the crisis. Worthy 
 daughters of worthy fathers and noble mothers, I glory in your 
 spirit and rejoice that I am one of you and feel an extra pride that 
 I should be one to serve you in a capacity to know how splendid 
 you are. 
 
 Seemingly, during 1917-1918 every ounce of time and energy was 
 expended upon war work of all kinds, and later upon nursing influ- 
 enza, still the work of the Division went steadily on. It is there- 
 fore with the greatest of pleasure I bring to you my report.

22 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 Three new U. D. C. Chapters have been organized, the John W. 
 Bryant Chapter, Spring Hope; Fannie Patton Chapter, Asheville, 
 and the Nash Chapter, Middlesex, and two Children of the Confed- 
 eracy Chapters; the Junior Confederacy Chapter, Wilson, and Carrie 
 Leazer Chapter, Morrisville. 
 
 I have sent out 1,046 application blanks, signed, sealed and sent 
 to the proper source, 265 Children of Confederacy certificates. I have 
 mailed 285 letters, 335 cards and 97 circular letters, and have sent to 
 the several new chapters and a few officers, minute books of the 
 Kinston Convention. Owing to the increase of postage during the 
 war the proceeds from the application blanks were not sufficient to 
 cover the postage for this office, hence I had to call on the Treasurer 
 for the amount of $10.61 for postage. 
 
 Many letters have been received and I have at all times tried to 
 reply promptly and if I discovered that a Chapter's interest was 
 lagging I tried to spur it to new life and in cases of increased 
 interest in the cause by individuals and Chapters it has been a joy 
 to say a few more words to them to stimulate that interest. 
 
 With a heart full of love for the Cause of the Confederacy and for 
 you, dear sisters, in the work, I beg God's blessings upon us and 
 peace and happiness in the future. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Nannie M. Gary. 
 
 Mrs. Little moved tliat the Secretary's report be accepted 
 with thanks. Carried. 
 
 Report of Corresponding Secretary was read by Miss Powell.

 In a few words of appreciation of the work done by the 
 Treasurer, Miss Dfenson moved that the report be accepted. 
 
 Carried. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams made the following motion : 
 
 "I move that the money that has been carried for some years 
 as the Captain Smith Badge fund be transferred to the Hero 
 Education fund." 
 
 Seconded by Mrs. Marshall Williams. Carried. 
 
 Registrar's Report, owing to the absence of Mrs. McCullers, 
 was read by Miss Gary. 
 
 REGISTRAR'S REPORT 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy : 
 
 It gives me pleasure to present the following report for the 
 fiscal year now closing. In view of the fact that only half the 
 chapters sent in lists of members for comparison with the State 
 records, this report cannot be an accurate one. 
 
 It is gratifying to report that three hundred and fifty-four (354) 
 applications have been I'egistered during the year. Twelve mem- 
 bers were gained by demit from other states. 
 
 One new chapter, John W. Bryant of Spring Hope, with a mem- 
 bership of nineteen (19) has been added to our Division roll. 
 
 Below is a statement of the membership by chapters, showing 
 a total of five thousand two hundred seventy-three (5,273) :

42 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 With sincere appreciation of the consideration and courtesies ex- 
 tended me by my co-workers and trusting that my successor may be 
 a greater inspiration in the work this report is 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. Herbert McCuluers, 
 
 Registrar. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams moved that the report be accepted, 
 and the Registrar be given a rising vote of thanks. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that a telegram be sent to our 
 Registrar, Mrs. McCullers. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. H. A. London moved that messages be sent to Mrs. 
 Parsley, our Division Mother, and Mrs. Leo. Heartt. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash requested Miss Powell to send messages to the 
 following ladies : 
 
 Mrs. Parsley, Mrs. Leo. Heartt, Miss Rebecca Cameron and 
 Mrs. Pender. 
 
 Recorder of Crosses report read by Mrs. R. L. Gwyn. 
 
 RECORDER OF CROSSES' REPORT. 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 Now that our soldier boys are returning home, many of them 
 decorated with the Cross of Honor, our thoughts turn back to our 
 own brave soldier boys of the Confederacy, who fought for four long 
 years, ill-clad and half fed, fighting and marching for days upon a 
 ration of parched corn. They also stood in muddy trenches, and 
 we realize more and more what they endured, and how brave and 
 self-sacrificing they were; soldiers never lived who could more 
 worthily wear the Cross of Honor. 
 
 During the year 1918 forty-two crosses have been bestowed in 
 our Division. Every letter received by your Recorder has been 
 promptly answered, in almost every instance by return mail. 
 
 There have been some disappointed Chapters because crosses were 
 not received on time, but this is because the applications were either 
 not sent in early enough, they must be in the Custodian General's 
 hands three weeks before the day of bestowal, others were not made 
 out correctly, several having been lost in the mail or express. I 
 deeply deplore these delays and disappointment.

 There is necessarily some "red tape" in securing the crosses, but 
 please remember the Recorder did not make the rules, but she must 
 abide by them! 
 
 I hope that during the coming year the descendants, whose parents 
 failed to receive their crosses, will make every effort to secure them.

 HISTORIAN'S REPORT. 
 
 The "Raines Banner" was presented to the North Carolina Divi- 
 sion last November for collecting and compiling more historical 
 records in 1917 than any other division. I was present at the Gen- 
 eral Convention and when I received the banner into my own hands 
 I do assure this body it was one of the proudest and happiest mo- 
 ments of my life. To feel that in serving my Division I was also 
 preserving to the State history which might otherwise have been 
 lost made me doubly happy. 
 
 This year the work of the Chapters has been curtailed very much 
 as the Daughters of the Confederacy have been busily engaged help- 
 ing our Government make history rather than following the peace- 
 ful pursuits of writing and collecting historical data. Still, I con- 
 sider they have responded to my circular letter, sent out early in 
 the year, in a wonderful manner and many unusually fine papers 
 have been sent to me, especially reminiscences by old ladies, who 
 have had many long forgotten events of the "60's" brought to their 
 recollection by the tremendous war drama of today. 
 
 The Contest for the "Raines Banner" is the only General Division 
 Contest our Division is competing for this year, 1918, because the 
 Reminiscence Prizes were discontinued and none of the Daughters 
 were inclined to write on the subject of "Southern Ideals" for the 
 Silver Loving Cup offered by the son of Mrs. S. E. F. Rose. How- 
 ever, in the North Carolina Division this year we have four contests 
 of our own, owing to the patriotism and generosity of four Daugh- 
 ters of the North Carolina Division.

44 Minutes of the Ttventy-second Annual Convention 
 
 1. Mrs. S. A. Kindley, of Gastonia, offers a handsome loving cup 
 in memory of her mother, to be presented each year to the Chapter 
 accomplishing the most historical work. 
 
 2. Mrs. Thomas Wilson, of Gastonia, offers for 1918 $10.00 in 
 gold to the Chapter that sends the best reminiscence from a woman 
 of the Confederacy. 
 
 3. Mrs. Caldwell Wilson, of Gastonia, offers for 1918 $10.00 in 
 gold to the Chapter sending the best reminiscence from a Veteran. 
 
 4. Mrs. T. W. Bickett offered through the J. J. Davis Chapter, 
 Louisburg, $20.00 in gold to the Veteran himself who writes the 
 best reminiscence. 
 
 When I realized my responsibility in deciding the merits of the 
 splendid papers sent me, I resolved to select the best in each class 
 and submit them to a competent critic to choose the winning paper. 
 Judge Walter Clark kindly consented to undertake the task for the 
 Veterans and Miss Cordelia Phifer, a former State Historian of 
 the D. A. R. for the women's reminiscences. I asked Judge Clark 
 to write his choice in each of the Veterans' Contests and place in 
 an envelope and seal it, the seal not to be broken until Historical 
 evening. I followed the same procedure with the Wilson prize for 
 the best woman's reminiscence — Miss Phifer sealing her choice also. 
 These will be opened in your presence historical evening. 
 
 The three papers by living veterans, selected as best of those sent 
 to Historian in 1918 are — one by Capt. Waddell, sent by Asheville 
 Chapter. 
 
 One by Mr. Edmund Jones, of Lenoir, sent by John Dunham 
 Chapter. 
 
 One by Col. E. A. Osborne, of Charlotte, sent by Stonewall Jack- 
 son Chapter. 
 
 The prize of $20.00 in gold will be given to veteran, whose paper 
 is awarded the prize by Judge Walter Clark. 
 
 Equally good papers were sent to Historian contesting for prize 
 offered by Mrs. Caldwell Wilson of $10.00 in gold to Chapter sending 
 in the best reminiscence by veteran, living or dead. Those selected 
 as the best are: 
 
 One by Rev. J. B. Whitaker (deceased) sent by Johnston-Pettigrew 
 Chapter, Raleigh. 
 
 lOne by Mr. Erel sent by Johnston-Pettigrew Chapter. Raleigh. 
 
 One by Mr. Ledbetter (deceased) sent by Gastonia Chapter, 
 Gastonia. 
 
 Judge Clark will also award the Wilson prize for the finest of 
 these three reminiscences. 
 
 The women's reminiscences were so many and so fine that it was 
 exceedingly difficult to make a just selection. It was almost im- 
 possible to discriminate between four superb papers. These are: 
 
 A Reminiscence by "Little Reb" (nom de plume) sent by John W. 
 Dunham Chapter. 
 
 One by Rachel Pearsall sent by Gastonia Chapter. 
 
 One by Mrs. Ida Wilkins, President Junius Daniel Chapter, 
 Weldon. 
 
 One by Mrs. William Howard of W. Dorsey Pender Chapter, Tar- 
 boro. 
 
 Miss Phifer placed her award in sealed envelope to be opened 
 Historical Evening. 
 
 The Chapter Contest for which Mrs. S. A. Kindley offers a silver 
 loving cup will be decided by the data written on the Chapter Re- 
 ports and not by me. The Chapters doing the best historical work 
 are Asheville, Fayetteville, Mrs. J. H. Anderson, historian; Gastonia, 
 


## p. 45 (#49) ##############################################

United Daughters of the Confederacy 45 
 
 Mrs. Thomas Wilson historian; Raleigh, Mrs. S. J. Ellis historian, 
 and Wilson, Mrs. H. G. Connor, historian. May I suggest that any 
 one of these able women would make a fine State Historian. Mrs. 
 Gudger, President of the Asheville Chapter, managed the historical 
 department as well as presided over the affairs of her Chapter. 
 I have not yet placed the papers of 1917 in the Hall of History. It 
 seems to me the best of the papers of both 1917 and 1918 should be 
 published in some form for the benefit of the present generation 
 before putting them where they will only be accessible to searchers 
 of historical records. I hope the convention will consider this 
 matter. 
 
 The reading of so many papers of thousands of pages, though 
 the contents is intensely interesting, is a laborious task. These 
 papers have to be filed, the Chapters and persons given credit 
 and acknowledgment when possible. The best are read over 
 many times so as to judge their merits for the ^'Contests" and 
 one can imagine the nervous strain this part of the work 
 entails. 
 
 Getting out the Eeport on the "Raines Banner" Contest 
 means a circular letter sent to Chapters asking for account of 
 all phases of historical work and blanks for same to be filed; 
 filing and comparing these, besides incorporating the Report 
 of the Education and Scrap Book Chairman and oh any out- 
 standing historical work in the State generally. 
 
 That the "Raines Banner" was won again in 1918 for the 
 second consecutive year is a splendid reward to your Historian 
 and the Chapter historians who have so faithfully cooperated 
 in the work. 
 
 Daughters of the North Carolina Division, I feel that you 
 have greatly honored me in making me your Historian during 
 the past two years, for the work, though onerous, has been 
 a labor of love. I thank you for your consideration and the 
 beautiful letters of appreciation many of you have written.

48 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 The children's work is a very important one, they are the founda- 
 tion on which the U. D. C. work is to be carried on in years to come. 
 The children of today are the daughters of tomorrow, and it is 
 through them that our work will continue to live. 
 
 I am disappointed not to report every chapter in the State regis- 
 tered, I had hoped to accomplish that this year. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 (Mrs. L. T.) Isabelle T. Townsend, 
 Director of Children, N. C. Div., U. D. C. 
 
 Mrs. Hunter Smith moved that the report be accepted and 
 that Mrs. Townsend be given a rising vote of thanks. 
 
 Report of the Executive Committee was read by Miss Gary, 
 the Recording Secretary, and acted upon separately. 
 
 REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 
 
 The Executive Committee of the North Carolina Division, United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy, met with Mrs. Walter F. Woodward 
 at the Country Club at 2 o'clock, April 29, 1919. 
 
 The Committee was called to order by the President, Mrs. Thrash. 
 Nine members reported present. Business was immediately taken 
 up. During the hour of meeting Mrs. Thrash expressed the great 
 pleasure felt by the Committee at having present Miss Mary B. 
 Poppenheim, the President General. High tributes were paid to 
 Miss Poppenheim, to Mrs. Thrash and the Board. 
 
 The following recommendations of the President were read 
 and approved by the Executive Board : 
 
 Recommendation I. — Under rule for registration, all applications 
 must be signed by the applicant herself. No exception to this rule 
 can be made by either the State Registrar or President of a Chapter. 
 
 Moved by Mrs. Marshall Williams that it be accepted. 
 Seconded by Mrs. F. R. "Williams. Adopted. 
 
 Recommendation II. — Application blanks of old members, never 
 registered before, should bear the date of the year they joined and 
 signed by the then President and Secretary. Let their new papers 
 be marked "duplicate, original lost." The Credental Committee 
 named at that time omitted. By no means register as joining at 
 the present time. 
 
 A discussion followed as to the feasibility of having these 
 blanks signed by the President and Recording Secretary of the 
 Chapter, who were in office at the time that applicant joined. 
 One of the memibers of the Executive Committee called the 
 attention of the Convention that the words "if possible" should 
 have been recorded in the recommendation.

 There followed a discussion as to the proper procedure in 
 cases where the President and Recording Secretary were dead. 
 The President General, being called upon, stated that all that 
 was necessary to he done was for the applicant to go with her 
 Chapter President before a Notary Public, and upon exhibiting 
 the records showing that such a person joined the Chapter at 
 that time, make affidavit of the same, receiving the JSTotary's 
 
 Amended and passed. 
 
 Recommendation III. — That in as much as the Constitution cannot 
 be amended in the next two years, the Board recommends that two 
 or more districts unite for the next year in holding their meetings, 
 thereby creating a greater interest and enthusiasm. 
 
 Vote was taken and the recommendation tabled. 
 
 Recommendation IV. — All members shall fill out three applica- 
 tion blanks, one to be kept by the Chapter, one for the State Regis- 
 trar and one for the General Registrar. All three will, however, 
 have to be sent, so as to be numbered and returned. 
 
 Passed by the General Convention. Adopted by the ISTorth 
 Carolina Division. 
 
 Recommendation V. — A resolution was passed by the General Con- 
 vention also "that each Chapter subscribe to the Veteran for one 
 or more subscriptions and try and place it in schools and public 
 libraries." 
 
 Accepted. 
 
 The President, Mrs. Thrash, asked that the 4th and 5th 
 Recommendations be put upon the page of "Things to be 
 Remembered" in the Minutes. 
 
 Recommendation VI. — That the North Carolina Division follow 
 the way blazed by Virginia, Mississippi and South Carolina and in 
 the future hold independent conventions. 
 
 Tabled. 
 
 It was requested that the words "Independent Convention" 
 be defined, that all delegates might understand. Independent 
 Convention : One held in a city with a hotel large enough to 
 accommodate the delegates who would pay their own expenses. 
 The Executive Board deciding on the city and a contribution 
 from each Chapter be placed in the Treasury to defray expenses 
 of said Convention.

 REPORT OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. 
 
 NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION, UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE 
 
 CONFEDERACY. 
 
 Madam President, and Fellow Members of the Division: 
 
 For the fourth year I bring you a summary of our work in Educa- 
 tion. Two requests, blanks to be filled out, have been mailed to 
 each chapter, asking for a detailed and itemized account of all 
 educational work done. One set I mailed myself last fall, one set 
 together with a statement from Miss Moses about the General En- 
 dowment and 1917-1918 Hero Fund, Miss Gary sent out with this 
 convention call. 
 
 From our ninety-nine chapters forty-nine replies were received, 
 showing a total of 35 Division, District and Chapter Scholarships, 
 valued at $2,132.00. 
 
 The reports of money contributed to our Division Scholarship 
 Fund are so incomplete and so confused with contributions to 
 the General Education Endowment Fund that my figures do not 
 at all agree with the amounts your Treasurer has handled. How- 
 ever, I am expecting such a glare of explanation and such a gale 
 of enthusiasm for this 1917-1918 Hero Fund at this convention 
 from our War Relief Committee and from our President General, 
 that there will not be one confusing cobweb of misunderstanding 
 left in any single chapter. 
 
 Our Normal Scholarships, which we must now learn to call our 
 Division Scholarships at the North Carolina College for Women, 
 are the most in demand of anything we have to offer, and should 
 be supported by every chapter, 10 cents per member would easily 
 pay the $450.00 which the Division pledges to this cause. The 
 R. E. Lee Chapter, Lexington, and the James B. Gordon Chapter, 
 Winston-Salem, each supports their own scholar at Greensboro, the 
 North Carolina College, and the Thirteenth District set a good 
 (luck) example by giving a $50.00 Liberty Bond to this Division 
 Fund.

 The Elvira Worth Moffltt Loan Fund kept up two scholarships 
 this year, the interest paying one and the payment of last year's 
 loan the other. 
 
 Your committee labored strenuously to fill all Division scholar- 
 ships, but six remained unused from lack of help from nearby chap- 
 ters, and because some assistance besides tuition is needed by most 
 applicants. One of the scholarships awarded to this State by the 
 General Education Committee, that at St. Mary's School, Memphis, 
 had to be given up because the applicant could not meet the other 
 expenses. But besides this our State used five of the most valuable 
 general scholarships: Vassar (where our Alice Sawyer has just 
 graduated with honor), Lucy Cobb, the University of Virginia, and 
 the University of North Carolina. Very few applications are on file 
 for this year, I regret to admit, so please do some advertising! 
 
 As to the other branches of work classed as educational, 6 medals, 
 worth $26.00 and 5 prizes, worth $23.00, have been given for essays 
 on subjects of Confederate interest. Eleven portraits of generals 
 have been presented to schools at a cost of $45.00. Three chapters 
 support and run the libraries of their respective towns and as many 
 more conduct the Lyceum Courses. Thirteen chapters report books 
 given to soldiers, 1,300 volumes valued at over $800.00. 
 
 In the aggregate, our educational achievements of the past year 
 make a better showing than might have been expected, but they 
 would be twice as good if every chapter told all they did and if the 
 slack teams picked up their share of the load. Now that the war 
 is over, let us "go over the top" in education, just as we have done 
 in war relief!

 Mrs. H. A. London moved that the report be accepted. 
 Seconded and carried. 
 
 Mrs. Little spoke of the arduous work connected with the

 tion of Miss Gash's work. 
 
 Mrs. Moffitt made report of the Elvira Worth Moffitt Schol- 
 arship. 
 
 REPORT OF ELVIRA WORTH MOFFITT SCHOLARSHIP. 
 
 For twelve years a Memorial Fund was being collected from the 
 chapters for erecting a memorial gate to the Confederate Cemetery 
 of Raleigh, N. C, in commemoration of the one thousand dead who 
 lie buried there from all thirteen Southern States. At the end of 
 twelve years, the Confederate Memorial Association decided we 
 could not erect this gate, for the reason it necessitated the taking 
 up of fifteen graves. At a convention held several years ago the 
 fund was voted to go into the Educational Fund. The association 
 voted that it be named the Elvira Worth Moffitt Loan Fund, and

 used at the Normal to educate girls who are descendants of Con- 
 federate Veterans. Mrs. Moffitt's nieces and nephews subscribed 
 the necessary amount to make up the sum of $1,500.00 for the loan 
 every year at the Normal School, North Carolina. 
 
 Accepted. 
 
 The War Relief Work report was made by its enthusiastic 
 and efficient Director, Mrs. R. P. Holt, of Rocky Mount. 
 
 REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF WAR RELIEF WORK. 
 
 Madam President General, President North Carolina Division, 
 Daughters, Friends: 
 
 As Director of War Relief Work in our Division. I greet you and 
 bring you your report,- — one that should be very different, for I 
 know you all are at work and as loyal as any set of women, but so 
 few chapters have sent in their reports, and many of those sent 
 were only filled out in part. 
 
 I realize that I haven't been able to do all that I should have 
 done during the past eighteen months, but circumstances were 
 such that I could do no more. I want to thank our President for 
 allowing me the privilege of doing this work, for it has been a 
 pleasure and a blessing to me. 
 
 I have sent out eight hundred and twenty (820) circular letters; 
 written two hundred and eighteen (218) letters; three hundred and 
 eighty (380) postals; sent notices of our work to seventy-five (75) 
 papers in the State; kept in constant touch with Mrs. Rountree, 
 Chairman of our Central Committee. As our President said in her 
 message, we have furnished the following beds: 
 
 1. Zebulon Baird Vance — In Honor of the War Governor of North 
 Carolina — ready February 25, 1918. 
 
 2. In Memoriam — The North Carolina Heroes — 1861-1865 — ready 
 in March, 1918. 
 
 Both of these beds were given by our Division. The following

 federacy. Ready June 10, 1918. 
 
 4. The Wayne County Bed — In honor the Wayne County Soldiers, 
 by Thos. Ruffin Chapter, Goldsboro, N. C. Ready in July, 1918. 
 
 I have sent two boxes to our beds in the hospital at Neuilly, 
 France; six Sambos from The Margaret Davis Hayes Chapter, Hen- 
 dersonville; a beautiful knitted comfort, with large Confederate flag 
 knit in the center, from the Guilford Chapter, Greensboro, which was 
 used on the Zebulon Baird Vance bed. 
 
 Another knitted comfort with the Stars and Stripes knit in one 
 corner, from the Mount Airy Chapter, which was being used on our 
 Bed in Honor of the North Carolina Heroes of '61-'65. 
 
 In the same box a large knitted comfort in gray with large red 
 cross in center — knit by the boys and girls of the tenth grade in 
 the Rocky Mount high school, and sent through the Junior Bethel 
 Heroes Children of Confederacy, which was used on the Rocky Mount 
 bed. Also for that bed, 12 linen pillow cases, 12 linen sheets, 3 
 Sambos, subscriptions to four magazines, 100 post cards, and book- 
 lets, about Rocky Mount, sent by the Junior Bethel Heroes. Sent to 
 Camp Jackson four comforts from the Margaret Davis Hayes Chap- 
 ter, Hendersonville. 
 
 Through your director, one lot of two hundred (200) pairs of 
 socks have been sent to a Y. M. C. A. secretary for use in France. 
 The Junior Bethel Heroes Children of Confederacy, giving one hun- 
 dred (100) of them, the others being given by individuals; also 
 1,240 pairs of socks to the 120th Infantry given by the Junior Bethel 
 Heroes Children of Confederacy. A beautiful knitted comfort knit 
 by eight little girls of the Confederacy of Bdenton, to be used on 
 one of the North Carolina beds. The children are interested in this 
 work and are only waiting for their leaders to suggest and work 
 with them. 
 
 They have raised $225.30 towards the Henry L. Wyatt bed, the

 Seine. France. Date of birth: September 22, 1908. 
 
 Estelle Bernard (Girl). Address: 48 rue de Paris, Petit Ivry, 
 Seine, France. Date of birth: July 18, 1910. 
 
 Madeline Dubin (Girl). Address: 67 rue d'Avron, Paris 20 
 Arrondissement, France. Date of birth: January 26, 1908. 
 
 Antoinette Bernard (Girl). Address: 27 rue de Verneuil, Paris 
 7 Arrondissement, France. Date of birth: April 4, 1914. 
 
 Louise Dessenne (Girl). Address: Ferme de Montrambourge, 
 Vierzy, Aisne, France. Date of birth: October 2, 1912. 
 
 Marcelle Dessenne (Girl). Address: Ferme de Montrambourge, 
 Vierzy, Aisne, France. Date of birth: April 6, 1914. 
 
 Very few of the Chapters have sent in the lists of lineal 
 descendants. Daughters, if your Central Committee had not 
 known this was important, do you think they would have asked 
 every organized Chapter of the U. D. C. to get these records? 
 Indiana won the $20.00 in gold offered the State for the largest 
 list. Can't we win in JSTovemher? 
 
 We realize it takes time and work, but if our boys can give 
 their all, can't we at least do our part to keep their records 
 straight ? Think, in years to come, what it will mean to them, 
 and their children. With all the work the Wilson Chapter had, 
 they sent in a list of three hundred (300). Daughters, it is 
 too late now to help your State to win The Youree Prize for 
 


## p. 56 (#60) ##############################################

56 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 the past year, but it isn't too late to get our State records and 
 win in November, 1919 ; so please eacb Daughter feel that it is 
 her business to help get these records. 
 
 The first of the year I sent a list of questions to each Chap- 
 ter and asked for a monthly report, but only a few noticed them 
 at all. If they had been answered each month our report would 
 have been so much better and not near the trouble to you. As 
 it is' only 45 Chapters, and 12 Children's Chapters, have 
 responded to the Central Committee's request for these blanks 
 to be filled out and returned. 
 
 One Chapter PresidcJnt writes as follows : "It seems that this 
 is all so needless, I think the one that had these questions sent 
 out ought to realize that Chapters like ours could not give time 
 to answering such questions. Not one of our members is will- 
 ing to undertake the getting up of the records." The D. A. R.'s 
 are reporting their work, therefore we don't want to report 
 twice." 
 
 Now Daughters, don't you think you owe it to your heroic 
 ancestors, your State and your Division, to do all you can 
 to keep the records and show to the world that our women 
 and our boys are as loyal and true as those of any other State. 
 Now please send me a report of all work you have done that was 
 not reported to me last year, for we want to complete our work 
 by November. 
 
 Daughters, all money left from our beds has gone into what is 
 known as the "1917-18 Heroes Educational Fund." Now each 
 State that raises $1,S 50.00, sent through its War Relief Director, 
 will be entitled to one of these scholarships in its own University, 
 and can name it whatever they prefer. Knowing your loyalty, 
 I pledged North Carolina would raise the required amount, and 
 up to date we have $549.87. Won't you now pledge the other 
 to be paid by June 15, 1919? 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Tempe Whitehead Holt, 
 Director War Belief Work.

60 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 Holt stated that a list of fifteen names were sent in to Mrs. 
 Beale, and that Mrs. Little's daughter was one of those named. 
 
 The President then asked the President General to give 
 some information as to the Hero 1917-1918 Fund and Educa- 
 tion Fund. 
 
 Miss Poppenheim stated that at the Louisville Convention 
 a motion was. made which provided that all money in hands of 
 the State Treasurer for the henefit of endowing beds in hospitals 
 in N'ueilly, France, should be transferred to the Hero Fund, 
 as these beds are no longer needed. 
 
 Mrs. Holt asked Miss Poppenheim if North Carolina could 
 transfer the sum of $500.00 pledged under the Endowment Fund 
 and place it as an Educational Endowment Fund to one of the 
 scholarships in North Carolina. Miss Poppenheim said it was 
 with North Carolina to say what she would do with her money. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams asked if it would be used as a scholar- 
 ship dedicated in memory of any one particular person. Mrs. 
 Holt said it would be a scholarship used as a memorial to all of 
 the boys who served. 
 
 After the discussion, Mrs. Loudon moved "that we accept 
 Mrs. Holt's report." Accepted with thanks. 
 
 After some discussion as to raising the fund for the scholar- 
 ship, the Director was asked Avhat amount she had on hand to 
 be applied for this purpose. She reported $549.87 already 
 raised towards the 1,250. 
 
 The President stated that of the $500.00 pledged by her at 
 Louisville for the Educational Endowment $310.00 is to be raised 
 by the Division, the balance having been pledged. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams asked that the Treasurer be consulted 
 and the $310.00 be paid from the funds. After discussion 
 pledges were given from the floor. 
 
 The following amounts were pledged by Chapters and indi- 
 viduals :

 REPORT OF THE CONFEDERATE WOMEN'S HOME. 
 Madam President and Daughters : 
 
 At no time in the world's history has there been a crisis when 
 woman has not been called upon for service, and at no time has 
 woman failed in her duty. Women are the sentiment makers of 
 the world. Wherever women are, sacrifice is. 
 
 And this year, with its many demands, has been no exception. 
 For your same loyalty for the descendants of the men of the '60's 
 who surrendered their lives in the great struggle for human free- 
 dom, in some respects surpasses last year's report.

64 Minutes of the Twenty -second Annual Convention 
 
 I am very glad to report the Home in good condition, and run- 
 ning smoothly. Our Superintendent, Miss Watters, has proved very 
 faithful and acceptable. And while there have come to us some 
 sorrows, during the year, many joys have been given the ladies. The 
 Fayetteville Chapter has been very considerate of their pleasure. 
 Through the efforts of our former President, Mrs. Bidgood, and our 
 present President, Mrs. Hall, afternoon teas and other entertain- 
 ments have been provided, which have been much enjoyed. The 
 Christmases of 1917 and 1918 were celebrated in a most festive 
 manner, a Christmas tree being filled with remembrances for all the 
 ladies, a beautiful Colonial entertainment was given through the 
 efforts of Miss Matthews, and a most generous donation of a beauti- 
 ful new Kimball piano by Mr. W. F. Blount, which filled a long felt 
 want. Chautauqua tickets and tickets to the County Fair are always 
 provided for those able to attend. 
 
 Our ladies have been much interested in Red Cross work and our 
 entire household joined the Red Cross, and were among the first 
 to offer their services for work. They have made more than 100 
 fracture and comfort pillows, knitted 100 pairs of socks and done 
 other Red Cross work, and enjoyed doing it. 
 
 Several nice piazzas have added to the comfort of the exterior of 
 the Home. The rooms in the Thrash Annex have been furnished 
 by Greensboro, Wilson and Durham Chapters, and by Mrs. Patterson 
 of Greensboro, and Mrs. Thomas of Charlotte. The checks and 
 boxes sent during the year have been much appreciated and added 
 much in a substantial way. We feel that the chapters that have 
 remembered the Home so liberally this year, amid the many other 
 calls and duties deserve our deepest thanks, and will be "thrice 
 blessed." 
 
 We feel very much the necessity of an increased appropriation 
 for maintenance, and regret very much that the General Assembly 
 did not give us an increased appropriation. We have been assured, 
 however, that we would be given an increase at the special session 
 that is to be called. We also need more downstairs room, as many 
 cannot be admitted on account of not being able to go upstairs. 
 A nurse will be needed permanently, as our family grows more 
 infirm each day and need more attention. Five thousand dollars a 
 year, the present appropriation, you can readily see, with the high 
 cost of living, is not sufficient to meet all the needs of the institution. 
 Let me urge every lady present to see her representative in person 
 and secure his support for an increased appropriation at the meet- 
 ing of the next Legislature. 
 
 We request that the Chapters that have not yet replenished their 
 respective rooms with bed linen, bureau scarfs and curtains send 
 them in as soon as possible. Gray gingham suitable for dresses 
 and aprons, and bleaching for underclothes would be most acceptable. 
 
 There have been admitted into the home since our last meeting, 
 twelve. The Reaper has called up higher seven of our family: 
 Mrs. Worth, Mrs. Loftin, Mrs. Chestnut, Mrs. Lewie, Mrs. Lee, Mrs. 
 Charles and Miss Clark. 
 
 The Home has filled its mission, a long felt need in North Caro- 
 lina, and the expressions that come to us and the continued loyalty 
 of the chapters is most gratifying. Expressions like these from our 
 ladies: "Didn't know I ever could be so happy again in this life" 
 make us feel repaid for the effort on the part of all, for those less 
 fortunate. 
 
 We feel that we have been most fortunate in securing the services 
 of Miss Williams as assistant to Miss Watters, to look after the in- 
 firm. She is gentle and kind, and a great comfort to the dependent.

 My hands have been very full this year, but the Confederate 
 Home, and our dear old ladies come next to my own home. I have 
 been chairman of and on seven different committees on war activ- 
 ities, and have given my two boys as volunteers to the service of 
 their country. And if I haven't answered all your letters as 
 promptly as usual, I feel you will pardon me, with such an anxious 
 heart. But now we feel that the silver lining is not far distant, 
 and with the hope that the war clouds may ever be dispelled, we 
 can promise more faithful service for the coming year.

 COMMITTEE TO ORGANIZE CAMPS OF SONS OF 
 
 CONFEDERATE VETERANS 
 
 Owing to the state of our Country in the World War, no definite 
 work has been done towards organizing Camps of Sons of Confed- 
 erate Veterans. But, in all patriotic meetings, especially when 
 speeding soldiers on their way, we have reminded them that a great 
 heritage of valor was already their's, and that a reunited country 
 could ask no better of them than to fight as their fathers had fought, 
 to go forth with the pure devotion to principle, the sublime courage, 
 the utter self-sacrifice of the men who wore the grey^those shining 
 heroes who are still willing to "Stand up for judgment to the tune 
 of Dixie Land." 
 
 Mrs. R. E. Little, 
 
 Chairman. 
 
 Mrs. Felix Harvey made a verbal report on visiting Gettys-

 The Veteran. I stress this because of the small space allotted for 
 Division publication in The Veteran, which must conserve time and 
 space. The ruling regarding this is as follows: 
 
 "Send reports to your Division State Editor, who 
 sends direct to Mrs. A. B. White, Editor in Chief, who 
 then rearranges all Division reports for publication in 
 
 The Veteran." 
 
 Do not send your reports direct to the office of The Veteran; 
 they will not be noticed, as The Veteran office is overcrowded. 
 
 The U. D. C. Editorial Staff work is one of the largest fields of 
 departmental activities, and should be conducted as all other depart- 
 ments are, if it is to be a medium of helpful exchange in the U. D. C. 
 family machine.

 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that this roll-call be postponed 
 until a more accurate list could be made. Seconded by Mrs. 
 London. Adopted.

 Mrs. Allison Hodges, in charge of the N^orth Carolina room 
 in the Confederate Museum in Richmond, read her report. 
 
 REPORT OF NORTH CAROLINA ROOM ON APRIL 29TH 
 TO THE CONVENTION IN WILSON, N. C. 
 
 Madame President and Daughters : 
 
 It is a great pleasure to bring to the North Carolina Division of 
 the U. D. C.'s greetings from the Confederate Memorial Literary 
 Society and to give a brief report of the North Carolina room in the 
 Confederate Museum, to the support of which, you have so gener- 
 ously contributed. 
 
 "The White House of the Confederacy" for many years after the 
 war was used as a public school, then some patriotic ladies con- 
 ceived the idea of preserving it as a Confederate Museum, so in 
 1890 they obtained a charter for this organization, and at once had 
 the building made fire-proof, and restored it as it was, when used 
 by President Davis. 
 
 A room was given to each Confederate State, then a Regent, liv- 
 ing in that State, and a Vice-Regent, living in Richmond were 
 appointed to take charge of these state rooms. 
 
 In 1896 the Confederate Museum opened its doors to the public, 
 and from this small beginning, the Museum has become a perpetual 
 memorial to our gallant men in Gray. It is visited by thousands

 each year, and recognized as one of the most important historical 
 sights in Richmond. In the year 1918, 5,523 visitors registered at 
 the Museum, of this number 3,373 were Northern and Foreign, 
 while 644 men in uniform, and 76 school children entered free of 
 charge. 
 
 When the Museum is fully endowed, we hope to abolish even the 
 small admission fee of 25c, as our object is to preserve and teach 
 the true history of the Civil War, and not to make money. No year 
 books were published this year, on account of the increased expense, 
 and difficulty in getting them printed. Many distinguished foreign, 
 as well as American officials, have visited the museum during the 
 present war, and their interest in the history of the great Southern 
 military leaders, and appreciation of the relics and manuscripts 
 collected there, prove that we "have builded better than we knew." 
 
 You, Daughters of North Carolina, are especially interested in 
 your room. It belongs to the State of North Carolina, not Vir- 
 ginia or Richmond, and you are its custodians. Thanks to the 
 faithful labors of our efficient Regent, Mrs. Latta C. Johnston, the 
 cordial cooperation of your State President, Mrs. Thaddeus Thrash, 
 and the financial help of the Daughters, I am happy and proud to 
 report that North Carolina was the first to complete the $3,000 
 endowment of her room, which was reported at the annual meeting 
 in January, 1918. 
 
 The demands made by the present war upon our time and strength 
 were so numerous and compelling, we did not undertake any new 
 work, but only emphasized the importance of filling in the Rolls of 
 Honor. 
 
 Gifts received from North Carolina the past year, are as follows: 
 
 Your State President, Mrs. Thrash, again sent us the handsomely 
 bound minutes of the North Carolina State U. D. C. procedings: 
 
 We are indebted to Mrs. Wm. J. Andrews, of Raleigh, for a por- 
 trait of the late Col. William Johnston, and 
 
 Mrs. Cox loaned the field glasses of Gen. Wm. Ruffin Cox, which 
 were broken by a bull6t, that probably saved the General's life. 
 
 Mr. R. D. W. Connor, secretary of the North Carolina Historical 
 Society, requested a brief statement of the work of the Museum, 
 and North Carolina's contribution to it, to go in the Manual of the 
 Legislature for 1919. This I wrote and sent to him. Contribution 
 of Chapters: Mrs. Ray, for the Chalmer's Glenn Chapter, $2.00; 
 Mrs. Pless, through Mrs. Johnston, Waynesville, $1.00; Enfield, 
 $1.00; Charlotte, $1.00; Hertford, $2.00.

 Each season I give the room and cases a thorough cleaning, and 
 take the necessary precautions for preserving the relics, and I wish 
 each lady here could see the many sacred relics in the Museum. 
 Last winter the sword of the gallant Marquis de Polignac was 
 given by his daughter, also the sword of the immortal Robert E. Lee, 
 and other relics too numerous to mention. The Museum sustained 
 a great loss in the death of the Virginia Regent, Miss Mary Custis 
 Lee, the last child of our beloved Confederate Chieftain. The daily 
 care of the Museum is gladly and faithfully given by the women of 
 Richmond, but the responsibility of its perpetual preservation, and 
 permanent endowment, rests upon the women of the whole South. 
 We must not forget that many such scenes of devastation and priva- 
 tion, as are seen in brave little Belgium today, were witnessed and 
 endured by our own parents fifty years ago in the War between the 
 States, and we must continue our Confederate work as a living 
 and perpetual memorial to them. 
 
 Respectfully submitted,

 sent a copy to tlie JSTorth Carolina room in the Museum; that 
 she did not believe any other State could show such a complete 
 record. 
 
 The President General said that she wanted to congratulate 
 North Carolina, as hearing of what North Carolina has done to 
 preserve her records has been an inspiration that she would 
 carry to her sister states. 
 
 The President, Mrs. Thrash, introduced General Julian S. 
 Carr to the Convention, and requested Mrs. Victor Bryant, of 
 Durham, to escort him to the rostrum. 
 
 General Carr then delivered an address in which he paid 
 a glowing tribute to the women of the South for their support 
 of the Confederacy, and their efforts since the war to keep alive 
 the sentiment that moved its soul. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams rose and paid a tribute to General 
 Carr. 
 
 General Metts, Colonel Benehan Cameron and Colonel Fred 
 A. Olds were called to the platform by Mrs. Thrash, the 
 President. 
 
 Mrs. H. A. London said that she wanted to call attention to 
 the fact that since the unveiling of the North Carolina monu- 
 ment at Appomattox in 1905 there had been a change in the 
 roadway, and the approaches to the monument were almost 
 inaccessible, and that she would like for the D'aughters to go on 
 record as requesting General Metts to appoint a committee to 
 look after this. 
 
 Mrs. Hunter Smith stated that she would like to substantiate 
 what Mrs. London had said ; that the grounds about the monu- 
 ment were badly kept. 
 
 General Metts promised that such a committee would be 
 appointed. 
 
 Mrs. Parrott was called to the chair while the President read 
 her report as State Director of the Jefferson Davis Monument 
 Fund. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash stated that it was with great pride that she could 
 say North Carolina was the first State to make the pledge of 
 25 cents per capita to complete the monument. 
 
 Report accepted.

 as her proudest boast that she was the daughter of a Confed- 
 erate Veteran.

 He also brought a message from the dead, that of a brave young

 the same having been captured at N'ewbern and several years ago 
 returned to North Carolina.

 a rising vote of thanks. 
 
 Mrs. Little, being recognized, asked to make the following 
 report : 
 
 When my term of office ended as President of the North Carolina 
 Division, my only regret was that I had not been able to make any 
 real progress on the Memorial Bridge to Stonewall Jackson at our 
 Training School in Concord. 
 
 As you will remember, the Charlotte Convention ordered this 
 bridge built and in all good faith I undertook the work. After 
 six months of disappointment by the company that was to furnish 
 the stone, Mrs. Sidney Cooper, my splendid Chairman, and I decided 
 to make a change. The Southern Railroad had furnished me a pass 
 to help raise funds for this Memorial and a frank for the transporta- 
 tion of the stone to Concord. The growing state of unrest, due to 
 War conditions, rendered our new contractor unable to start before

 On page 54, "After a visit to Concord, I realized the utter impracti- 
 cability of the bridge." Mr. Asbury, the Architect of the Chapel, 
 states that the bridge is entirely practicable, as it is only necessary 
 to cap the 10 1^ feet depth of the cut in the roadway about 3 feet. 
 I have paid his bill of $25.00 for the plan of the bridge which we 
 accepted. , 
 
 I quote a letter dated October 30, 1918, from the Superintendent of 
 the Training School: 
 
 "Your letter in reference to the bridge came yesterday and in 
 reply would say that if the parties who claim the bridge would be 
 of no service could only be here during a rainy week and pass over 
 the National Highway on Sunday behind the line of a hundred boys 
 they would change their opinion. The mud and slush last winter 
 was over the shoes of the boys. It was simply awful. Sometimes 
 in passing to and fro from church we have to break the line as 
 much as three or four times to allow machines to pass. We always 
 keep one man on the road to break the line, as with the number of 
 little fellows that we have, it is very dangerous. That the bridge 
 can be built there is no question. That it would be useful and 
 ornamental, no one conversant with conditions can deny. That it 
 would be very much appreciated, both by the authorities of the 
 school and the boys, we can assure." 
 
 A letter, dated June 18, 1918, from Mrs. Burgwin, President of the 
 King's Daughters, stated they hoped to take this bridge up as their 
 next work after the chapel is fully paid for, and she also told me 
 this at Raleigh on April 28th. 
 
 Mrs. Little stated that some money had been given by the 
 Frank Bennett Children's Chapter for this specific pui'pose, and 
 as the Memorial Bridge had not been built, she thought that the 
 money should be refunded to these children. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams: ''I move that these children be 
 refunded this amount." 
 
 Seconded. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams: "I move that this money be taken 
 from the Sinking Fund and repaid to the Wadesboro Children's 
 Chapter." 
 
 Carried. 
 
 The President regretted that the wishes of this Chapter were 
 not made known at the last Convention so that it could have been 
 paid more promptly. 
 
 The President then announced the arrival of Mrs. T. W. 
 Bickett, the wife of the Governor, and Chairman of the Stars 
 and Bars Committee.

80 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 On account of the War there was no Stars and Bars Memorial 
 report to be made by Mrs. Bickett. Mrs. Thrash read the fol- 
 lowing and suggested that the committee begin at once on this 
 memorial. 
 
 The following report on the designer of the Stars and Bars 
 was presented by Col. B. W. Green, of Little Rock, Ark. : 
 
 To the United Confederate Veterans in Convention Assembled at 
 Tulsa, Oklahoma, September 25, 1918: 
 
 Comrades: Your Committee, appointed to consider any and all 
 new evidence relative to the designing and making of the flag com- 
 monly known as the Stars and Bars, and who is properly and right- 
 fully entitled to the honor of its conception, design and execution as 
 the original maker, designer and originator, beg leave to report: 
 
 That they have considered all new evidence which has been placed 
 in their hands, and, after careful, full and complete investigation 
 of all such evidence and having fully read and digested all reports 
 heretofore made by committees which you have appointed for that 
 purpose, we find that it will not be wise or advisable to, in any way, 
 manner, shape or form, change or alter in any respect whatever the 
 report heretofore made you by your Committee appointed under 
 special order No. 30, September 14, 1914, and who reported at length 
 to you in convention assembled at Richmond, Virginia, in June, 
 1915, in which report your said Committee gave and conceded the 
 honor and fact of designing and making said flag known as Stars 
 and Bars to Major Orren Randolph Smith, of Lewisburg, North 
 Carolina, and we, your Committee, as above set out, do most heartily 
 concur in said report as made and delivered to you as aforesaid by 
 your said Committee at the Richmond Reunion, 1915. 
 
 Respectfully submitted on behalf of the Committee, 
 
 (Signed) B. W. Green. 
 
 On motion, it was unanimously received, approved and filed. 
 
 Wm. E. Mickle, 
 Adjt. Gen. and Chief of Staff. 
 
 Mrs. Hodges said that she would like to have a copy of this 
 paper for the North Carolina room in Richmond. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams then stated that she thought some 
 time ought to be set to unveil the tablets to General Ramseur 
 and General Pettigrew. 
 
 Mrs. London: "I move that the Governor of North Caro- 
 lina and his staff, the Governor of Virginia and his staff, be 
 present on the occasion." 
 
 Carried.

 tion United States Senator Dupont." 
 
 Mrs. Little : "I move that the 17th of July, the anniversary 
 of Jas. Johnston Pettigrew's death, be set as the date."

 sidered as read and filed with the Recording Secretary. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash : "I would like to announce that the Hero 
 1917-1918 Fund of $1,250 is completed." 
 
 Mrs. Thrash requested Mrs. Holt and Mrs. Little to give the 
 Convention some information concerning the book, "The 
 Women of the Sixties," that is to be compiled by Matthew Page 
 Andrews, 
 
 It was stated that if any one would like to send in the lives 
 of any distinguished Confederate women to send them in to Mr. 
 Andrews by May the 10th. Mrs. Fore, the State Historian, 
 was given the privilege of selecting a life from her historical 
 papers to send. 
 
 Mrs. Little stated that the North Carolina Division pledged 
 to buy 100 of these books at 75 cents each and sell them at $1.50, 
 retaining in the Chapter treasury 75 cents. 
 
 It was moved and seconded that $75 be taken from the Sink- 
 ing Fund to pay for these books to be sold to the Chapters. 
 Adopted. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash suggested that Mrs. R. P. Holt handle these 
 books for the Division. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash remarked that as a tribute of love it was her 
 purpose in the next few years to write a book covering the 
 work of 22 years of the Worth Carolina Division. This book 
 is to give in a concise manner all the facts concerning the work 
 of the Division from its organization. 
 
 The Hospitality Committee report was carried over to be 
 read during the Historical exercises. 
 
 COMMITTEE ON HOSPITALITY 
 
 It is a great privilege for us, the members of the Committee, to 
 be given this delightful opportunity by the Convention of the United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy of North Carolina to express the Con- 
 vention's appreciation of your lovely city and your charming people.

 The campaign for funds for this building will begin in early 
 summer. I therefore offer this resolution: 
 
 "I move that the North Carolina Division of the U. D. C. show 
 its approval of the erection in Raleigh of a memorial building to 
 our North Carolina soldiers and sailors of the late war, by contrib- 
 uting to it from the treasury. The amount of the contribution 
 to be decided upon by the Executive Board of the Division. Thus,

 we of the Division will have been the first organization to con- 
 tribute to it. And we will be very proud of the fact that we 
 substantially set our seal of approval on it, it being in line with 
 our memorial work. 
 
 I also propose that the chapters give this year as much as they 
 can raise for this building. 
 
 The Contribution from the Division to be given or promised now 
 at this Convention."

 moved that we borrow $100 from the Treasurer and each Chap- 
 ter make it up.

 Liberty Loan Bonds. 
 
 Mt. Olive claims, with Wimington, the distinction of being 
 the first Chapter to buy a $100 Liberty Bond. Although the

 ing to know that our veterans and widows of the Civil War were by 
 no means neglected, generous donations having been made to the 
 Soldiers' Home and the Old Ladies' Home. 
 
 An increase of membership was reported. A concensus of opinion

 Annie Turnley responded in behalf of the District to the welcome 
 and voiced the grateful appreciation of all. 
 
 War service was the keynote of the meeting and in all the reports 
 it was shov\'n how the Daughters, realizing the great exigencies of 
 the hour, had put aside all work except the Veterans' and Con- 
 federate Woman's Relief Work, for the War work. Splendid 
 reports were given from New Bern, Trenton, Jacksonville, More- 
 head, Pollocksville and Kinston.

 next State President. Miss Dita Roberts presented for view an 
 old pair of knitting needles, made of wood and used by a lady in

 District No. 15 reports a most gratifying meeting on Saturday, 
 April 27th. in Littleton. The exercises were held in the auditorium 
 of the new graded school building. After serving a most enjoyable 
 luncheon in one of the class rooms, the meeting was called to 
 order by the Director, and opened most impressively with a fervent 
 prayer by Rev. A. D. Betts of Greensboro, a Veteran, having been 
 Chaplain of the Thirtieth North Carolina Regiment. The Colonel 
 of this Regiment was a Halifax County man. Colonel Frank M.

 from President Wilson thanking the District for the message of loy- 
 alty sent him at the last meeting, was read by the Secretary. Chapter 
 reports were read and showed loyal U. D. C. work and great activity 
 in the Red Cross. All the Chapters in the District, except one, 
 which had a case of need in its midst, responded to an appeal sent 
 out by the Director for aid to a feeble veteran, a native of this 
 county, but living in Mecklenburg County for years. 
 
 The nominations for Director, to be elected, was called for, 
 resulting in the unanimous election of Miss Ruby Vinson, of 
 Littleton. Miss Susie Fitzpatrick, Chairman of the Committee 
 to expend the funds given by the Halifax County Commissioners 
 to send financially unable veterans of the county to the Reunion 
 at Washington, June 1918, gave her report: Receipts, $400; dis- 
 bursements, $285.00; balance, $115.00, which was returned to the 
 Commissioners. 
 
 Historical sketches of three military companies going out from 
 towns in the county during the War between the States were read: 
 The Enfield Blues, by Miss Susie Fitzpatrick; The Halifax Light 
 Infantry, by Mrs. Sterling M. Gary, and Company D, of the 
 24th Regiment, by Mrs. Ida Wilkins, of Weldon. Three other 
 companies were furnished by Halifax County, but there were no 
 papers to represent them. The Daughters stood for a few moments, 
 as a token of respect, to the deceased Director of District No. 17, 
 Mrs. Patrick Matthews, of Edenton, who was known and loved in 
 this District.

 in response to a letter sent out by our president, a splendid collection 
 of canned fruits and vegetables was given to the Soldiers' Home 
 and to our Confederate Woman's Home. At this meeting Miss 
 Mabel Kornegay was elected as our President. On account of sick- 
 ness in her home she has not been able to look after the work, 
 and has just recently turned the responsibility over to the Vice- 
 President. At a recent meeting we donated all possible funds for 
 a bed in France and have plans to raise a larger fund for the same.

 NEWTON— RANSOM SHERRILL CHAPTER, No. 653. 
 
 Besides our work for Veterans and Education our great work 
 during the past eighteen months has been for our boys in the 
 Great War. All of our members belong to the Red Cross and we 
 were 100 per cent true as workers. Our Chapter had 23 stars 
 on its service flag, and thank God, all are still blue, though one 
 should change to silver. The 30 resident members did the following 
 amount of work: Knit 50 sweaters, 158 pairs socks, 20 pairs 
 wristlets, 30 mufflers, 2 helmets, 2 blankets; one by the Children 
 of the Confederacy; 50 pairs stockings and 50 sweaters for refugee 
 children. They made 250 hospital garments, cut 500 other garments, 
 made 850 refugee garments besides packing and handling 2,496 
 lbs. refugee clothing; made 400 comfort kits; bought $9,700 bonds; 
 $6,295 Stamps and sold $20,000 Bonds, $15,000 Stamps. Besides 
 giving to every call for money for any and every cause, organized 
 5 white and 5 colored auxiliaries. Five of our members wear the 
 Red Cross service pin with blue ribbon, two with one white stripe 
 and one with two white stripes. They have led in all Red Cross, 
 Liberty Loan and War Savings Stamp work. The chairman, treas- 
 urer and secretary of the local Chapter, are U. D. C. Chairman War 
 Fund Drive, of first, second and fourth Liberty Loan Drives. Sub- 
 Chairman Food Administration, Chairman Music and Education, 
 Canteen Woman's work. Knitting and Refugee work. Helped with 
 funds for our volunteer and motor corps. Now our War work is 
 finished we will welcome home our Catawba boys and then devote 
 our energies to our Hero Educational Fund and Jefferson Davis 
 monument.

 WILKESBORQ— WILKES VALLEY GUARD CHAPTER, No. 1376. 
 
 Our Chapter has been disbanded since spring of 1918. We tried 
 to do War work. On March 3, 1919, we reorganized and hope to 
 be able to have a better report for 1919. We supported a French 
 orphan for 1918, and have sent check for 1919, $36.50. 
 
 PITTSBORO— WINNIE DAVIS CHAPTER, No. 259. 
 
 We cannot do too much work for the Veterans whose services 
 and lives have made it possible for us to be Daughters of the 
 Confederacy. Besides the work for our Veterans, the U. D. C. work 
 is mainly memorial; and on a line with our memorial work for 
 our U. D. C, we have undertaken at the request of Mr. Ossian 
 Lang, of the W. C. C. S., to aid in the placing in each school in 
 the county a memorial tablet containing the names of those men 
 


## p. 104 (#108) ############################################

104 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 which the school has given to the War. A committee of the Chapter 
 went before the County Commissioners and asked that they place 
 in the Court House a Memorial Tablet, bearing the names of all 
 men, white and colored, from Chatham County, who lost their lives 
 in the service of their country during the late War. They agreed 
 to this and requested us to aid them in getting the correct names. 
 The Winnie Davis Chapter has a cabinet in which we keep our 
 Confederate relics, placed in the corridor of the Court House, and 
 we have asked the Commissioners to also have one for the relics 
 of this War, the custodian of our Confederate cabinet being in 
 charge of both. So we U. D. C.'s have at heart the interests of 
 these young soldiers and sailors — the descendants of our brave men 
 who wore the Gray — the followers of General Lee. The Chapter is 
 getting up a "play" — the proceeds to help our Pittsboro high school 
 in placing its tablets. It will require two, as so many boys went 
 from this school into the War. The presiding Judge at our Court 
 always makes the memorial address on May 10th. We are not a 
 very large Chapter, but we are very enthusiastic and love the 
 Confederate work. The older members always tell incidents that 
 they now of at our Chapter meetings. I am glad to remember 
 that my mother took up her wool carpet and made of it blankets 
 for our soldiers in 1864.

 RAEPORD— RAEFORD CHAPTER, No. 1279. 
 
 The Raeford Chapter now has 52 members, has met all obliga- 
 tions, and have been trying to do our bit in War work. Nearly 
 every member is a member of the local Red Cross and has been 
 doing most of the work through it. We have kept an accurate 
 report of that. As a Chapter we have contributed $41.00 to bed 
 in France, furnished 155 comfort bags to Hoke County boys going 
 to camps; spent $29.00 for wool to knit for our boys.. Sent two 
 boxes of eats and one of books to boys at camps. Donated to 
 local Red Cross $15.00 in money and 33 sheets for hospital cots. 
 Besides this work the Chapter has sent $5.00 to Soldiers' Home 
 and a box of canned goods and some linen to Confederate Woman'^ 
 Home; $5.00 in gold for best essay on "Cause Which Led to War 
 between the States," won by Miss Ella Mae McFayden; $5.00 to 
 District Scholarship at Flora MacDonald. We gave a dinner to 
 Veterans on June 3d, and enjoyed an experience meeting with them 
 afterward. Sent wreaths to graves of two deceased Veterans. 
 
 RALEIGH— JOHNSTON-FETTIGREW CHAPTER, No. 90. 
 
 We contributed $25.00 to Hospital bed, $25.00 to Y. M. C. A. (War 
 work), $5.00 to North Carolina Veterans to help defray expense 
 to the Reunion. Our Chapter was active in Red Cross work, as 
 well as other activities.. We have been so identified with the 
 War organizations that we have never been able to get reports as 
 to the especial amount of work done by the Chapter members. 
 On the last Liberty Loan Drive, the committee from the Johnston- 
 Pettigrew Chapter secured $12,000 in one day as their part in the 
 work. Influenza stopped all meetings of the Chapter during the 
 fall and early winter.

 have gone before. The school children took part in the exercises 
 and after the address a nice, beautiful dinner is served. Every

 Davis Monument Fund; $15.7.5 to the Bed in France, and helped 
 in a great many ways through the Red Cross. We have paid all 
 dues, and while our Chapter is not doing any great big thing, I 
 feel that we accomplish right much in a small way. We meet every 
 month and the meetings are well attended anad interesting; the 
 Veterans are our first thought in all our work. With hearty

 esting program was held in the Court House on Memorial Day, 
 a sumptuous dinner served to the Veterans, their wives and widows. 
 Complimentary tickets were given on that day to the Veterans to 
 the picture show and the graves of dead Veterans decorated. 
 
 We have the following Red Cross work to our credit: We made

 We contributed the amount asked, $5.00, to the Hospital bed in 
 Neuilly, France, in 1918. Our regular dinner to our Veterans, 
 numbering about 125, was served last year on May 10th. and we are 
 planning an exceptionally nice one for this year. We have responded 
 to all calls from our Veterans, and in cases of death evergreen 
 wreaths have been provided for their graves. The War stopped 
 the work of beautifying an old cemetery in our town in which more 
 Veterans are buried than in any other graveyard in the county. 
 The District meeting which was to have been held in Statesville 
 this year by the Chapters composing our District, was called off by 
 Mrs. Reid on account of the celebrations in the various communi- 
 ties for returning soldiers. While we cannot report as a Chapter 
 any great amount of War work done, we did furnish the Chapter 
 Secretary and the Secretary of the Home Service Section in the 
 person of our President, aad the Chairman of Woman's Work in 
 Mrs. L. White in the Red Cross work. Practically all of our mem- 
 bers were regular workers in the sewing room or as knitters, and 
 almost all own War Savings Stamps and Liberty Bonds, some of us 
 having bonds of every issue. Our Children's Chapter joined the 
 Junior Red Cross almost as a unit.

 wreath tied with Confederate colors. Mrs. L. J. Ingram makes 
 most of these wreaths — a labor of love with her. "We contributed

 really have thirty-four (34) members in our Chapter, but the four 
 applications for membership were delayed in some way and not 
 returned to the wi'iter in time to get the names before our taxes

 WELDON— JUNIUS DANIEL CHAPTER, No. 600. 
 
 In 1917-1918 during the World War we were not slackers, but 
 responded to the Red Cross appeal and to the Army Y. M. C. A., 
 giving $5.00 to each and $20.00 to the Vance Bed in the military 
 hospital in Neuilly, France. Our meetings were opened and closed 
 with prayers for our soldiers and sailors who were fighting at the 
 front. We sent two silk flags to the families of two boys reported 
 killed at Chateau-Thierry. Besides our War activities we sent 
 canned goods to the Confederate Woman's Home and a birthday 
 box to each inmate. Contributed $5.00 to the Jefferson Davis 
 monument and $1.00 to the portrait fund. We secured one scholar- 
 ship. We are planning to hold our memorial exercises May 9th in 
 the school auditorium. Hon. Tasker Folk of AVarrenton will make 
 an address and the Chapter will present to the school a picture of 
 Capt. William T. Shaw, who was killed by the explosion of a shell 
 July 18th, 1918, near Chateau-Thierry.

 having sold in the Third Liberty Loan alone $90,000 worth of bonds;

 Owing to influenza conditions our Chapter has not held regular 
 meetings. The children have been active in War work, the Presi- 
 dent's children taking the lead gathering and selling raspberries for 
 their Red Cross money, earning $3.75. Contributed $5.00 for Red 
 Cross and $7.00 toward a military cot in France, later turning over 
 to the Educational fund. When each child joins a historical account 
 is given of its parents' or grandparents' part in the War. The 
 children are most active in serving the Veterans on June 3d, when 
 a dinner is served the Veterans at the President's home. Then 
 again the children are serving at the District meeting which the 
 Vets hold every year in August at Laurel Park. A new awakening 
 of enthusiasm is apparent among the children and we hope to do 
 great things the coming year.

 Our Cliapter has lost 8 members this year. Four have moved 
 from town, and the others are ready to join the Mother Chapter. 
 A number of new names will be soon added to our roll. This 
 summer, owing to the scarcity of sugar, we could not have our 
 annual supper (our usual mode of raising money), so our funds 
 are limited. Our Leader had to be away, and we have waited her 
 return to plan something else. We have aided needy Veterans, 
 their wives and widows here. We have given $3.00 to our local 
 Red Cross Chapter, and assisted in work room. It is a real pleasure 
 to feel that we are doing a bit for the boys "Somewhere in France." 
 One dollar was given to North Carolina Hospital Bed in France.

 as the years go by and so many of us join the men of Lee and 
 Jackson. Let us pause and guide and encourage these precious 
 girls — on whom our mantle is to fall.

 IN MEMORIAM 
 
 These exercises were presided over by the State Chaplain, Mrs. 
 A. H. Witherington, and opened by singing in unison, "Praise God, 
 from Whom all Blessings Flow." The invocation included Thanks- 
 giving for the world's great victory and prayer for God's blessings 
 for the President of the United States and those leaders united 
 with him in an effort for enduring peace. 
 
 An unusual and beautiful feature of the hour was the ceremony 
 of the Junior Confederates, under the leadership of Mrs. I. T. Smith. 
 As they marched, singing their "Song of Praise," accompanied by 
 the gifted organist, Mrs. Phylor, each carrying a basket of flowers 
 and placing them upon the altar, they produced an effect that was 
 thrilling and inspiring. The one hundred and forty-sixth Psalm 
 was used as an appropriate Scripture reading. 
 
 Memorials from the C. C. Blacknall Chapter to Mr. and Mrs. 
 O. W. Blacknall and Miss Kate Blacknall, were read by Mrs. Felix 
 Harvey. 
 
 An interesting sketch of the late Mrs. Rebecca Winbome, who 
 made the first Confederate flag, designed by Maj. O. R. Smith, was 
 read by Mrs. Fred Woodard. When the roll call for the departed 
 was read the list was found to exceed any ever given before at a 
 U. D. C. Convention. 
 
 Mrs. Witherington's tribute to those who had entered into their 
 rich reward, was very touching and beautiful. Quoting from Dean 
 Milmen : 
 
 "It little matters at what hour of the day the righteous fall 
 
 asleep, 
 Death cannot to him untimely who has learned to die; 
 The less of this brief life, the more of heaven, 
 The shorter time, the longer immortality." 
 
 Gen. Julian Carr, moved by the spirit of the hour, paid a most 
 eloquent tribute to the late Major London, also one to Mr. Jas. 
 A. Turner, Treasurer and Secretary of the Confederate Woman's 
 Home of Fayetteville. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash read tribute to Gen. Bennett H. Young, that will 
 appear in General Minutes. 
 
 Mrs. Witherington stated it was with deep regret that an in- 
 complete list of our North Carolina boys who had made the Supreme 
 Sacrifice in the Great World War, would forbid the roll call, but it 
 was an honor and our privilege to pay homage to the memory of 
 our North Carolina heroes who wore the khaki, whose service stars 
 are now turned to gold, those who fought for all that a Christian

 should revere; all that enlightened men hold dear, who gave their 
 lives, that the will of God might triumph. From the humblest 
 private to the highest officer, they are giving to those who love 
 and survive them, a perpetual source of moral inspiration. 
 In the words of Dr. George F. Greene: 
 
 Enough of merit has each honored name. 
 
 To shine untarnished on the walls of fame. 
 
 To add new lustre to the historic page." 
 
 After singing, "Nearer, my God, to Thee," the memorial hour 
 closed with "Mizpah."

 MEMORIAL TO MRS. WINBORNE 
 
 A tribute from Mrs. F. A. Woodard, read at the memorial hour 
 Thursday noon, May 1st, at the convention of the U. D. C. 
 
 MRS. REBECCA WINBORNE 
 Maker of the First Flag of the Confederacy 
 
 Wilson, July 26, 1918. — The death angel visited the home of Mrs. 
 Rebecca Winborne Tuesday morning about 2 o'clock and claimed 
 the grand old mother in Israel who had lived to the ripe age of 
 eighty-seven years. She is survived by two daughters, Mrs. H. T. 
 Webb, with whom she made her home, and Mrs. W. J. Whitfield, 
 one son, Mr. Charles Watson, by her first husband, fourteen 
 grandchildren, numerous great-grandchildren and hosts of friends 
 to mourn their irreparable loss. 
 
 A paragraph in an article written by Mr. R. B. Evans on the 
 subject is a fit introduction to this paper. He says: "The names of 
 Mrs. Winborne and the late Captain Orren Randolph Smith, of 
 Henderson, North Carolina, are inseparably linked together with 
 the Southern Confederacy, from the fact that Captain Smith designed 
 and Mrs. Winborne made the first Confederate flag." 
 
 Mrs. Winborne's almost accidental association with the coming 
 into existence of the Bonnie Blue Flag elevated a sweet, lovely, 
 Southern woman from the obscurity of every day life to a prominent 
 mention in the history of the Lost Cause. 
 
 Much has been said about the origin of the flag and it is not my 
 purpose to deal at length with that historical event but rather to 
 place before you something of the woman who stitched the stars 
 and bars on a field of blue and wrought the emblem that our fathers 
 fought under and our sons and daughters will love until the South 
 forgets, which the South never does. 
 
 Capt. Smith said, "The idea of my flag I took from the Trinity, 
 'Three in One.' The three bars were for the Church, the State and 
 the Press. Red represented state, legislative and judiciary; white 
 for church, Father, Son and Holy Ghost; red for press, freedom 
 of speech, freedom of conscience and liberty of the press — all 
 bound together by a field of blue (the heavens over all), bearing 
 a star for each state in the confederation. The seven white 
 stars, all the same size, were placed in a circle, showing that each 
 state had equal rights and privileges, irrespective of size and 
 population. The circle, having neither head nor foot, stood for 
 eternity, and signified, 'You defend me and I'll protect you.' 
 
 "I had the flag all complete in my mind before the Confederate 
 Congress advertised for models, and when the advertisement ap- 
 peared I went to my friend, Miss Rebecca Murphy (later Mrs. 
 Winborne), and asked her if she could make me a little flag. 
 


## p. 127 (#131) ############################################

 I'd tell her how. I tore the bars and cut the stars and she sewed 
 the stitches, and when finished the little flag was sent to Mont- 
 gomery, with the suggestion that a star be added for each State 
 that joined the Confederacy. The flag committee, as you all know, 
 accepted the flag and named it the Stars and Bars. They also 
 adopted the suggestion, and it was not long before the flag bore 
 eleven stars for the eleven Confederate States that voted for Jefferson 
 Davis to be President. After the small flag was sent to Montgomery, 
 I bought dress goods from Barrow's store and asked Miss Rebecca 
 to make me a large flag, nine by twelve feet, for whether the Flag 
 Committee accepted my model or not I was determined that one 
 of my flags should be floating in the breeze. Splicing two tall 
 saplings together, I made a pole a hundred feet high and planted 
 it on the court house square at Louisburg, North Carolina, and 
 the flag was sent aloft Monday, March 18th, 1861, two months 
 before North Carolina seceded. Over the flag was floating a long 
 blue streamer like an admiral has on his ship when homeward 
 bound, and on this pennant I had stars for each state that had 
 seceded and one for North Carolina, for, though my State was 
 still in the Union, I knew she was 'homeward bound.' 
 
 "I have been able from those who knew her to learn a few facts 
 in regard to the life of the woman, who as a young lady in 1861, 
 proudly and lovingly constructed the flag under which Lee and 
 Jackson led thousands of brave and patriotic Southern men to battles. 
 
 "In 1861 she was a young woman, with deep brown eyes, soft 
 dark hair, regular features of the Grecian type, a face that was both 
 attractive and intellectual. She was of average height and size. 
 
 "She was called Rebecca although her full name was Catherine 
 Rebecca Murphy. She was born in Louisburg, North Carolina, on 
 the 22d day of November, 1831. Her father, Joseph Murphy, was 
 for many years chief of police of Louisburg. During the war he 
 served in the army of the Confederacy. Her mother was named 
 Harriet Murphy. 
 
 "Rebecca was one of the early graduates of Louisburg Female 
 College. She was a studious girl and was regarded as brilliant 
 by her teachers and fellow pupils. After her graduation she accepted 
 a position as a teacher in South Carolina, and from then on, even 
 during her married life, she continued to teach for many years. 
 
 "In her early twenties she married Jerman Watson, a young man 
 who had come from Ottawa county, Virginia, and established a 
 buggy shop in Louisburg. They lived happily together for eight 
 years during which time three children were born to them: Edwin, 
 Enever and Charlie. After Mr. Watson's death his wife continued 
 her residence in Louisburg, and it was during her widowhood that 
 she made the flag.

128 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 "On the 4th day of March, 1866, Mrs. "Watson married a second 
 time. Her last husband was Mr. W. B. Winborne, a prosperous 
 farmer of Nash county, and a man who had served through the 
 war in the ranks of the Confederacy. There were three children 
 by this marriage, Harriet Josephine, who became Mrs. W. J. Whit- 
 field, and who now resides in Wilson; James, who died in infancy, 
 and Rebecca, now Mrs. H. T. Webb, of Wilson, N. C. 
 
 "Mrs. Winborne's second husband died on March 12, 1883. Some 
 eight years later she moved to Wilson county and made her home 
 with her daughters in the town of Wilson until her death on the 
 23d day of July, 1918, which came as a result of paralysis. 
 
 Mrs. Winborne was an earnest, sincere Christian, a member of 
 the Methodist church, which she had joined as a young woman. 
 It was said of her that from girlhood to her venerable old age she 
 has spent her life endeavoring always to do her bit towards making 
 the world happier and better. 
 
 "She was buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Wilson on Wednesday 
 following her death. The funeral was attended by the Daughters 
 of the Confederacy and the Jessie Barnes Camp Confederate Veter- 
 ans and latter acting as pallbearers. The bier was draped with 
 the 'Stars and Bars,' a silk ilag presented to Mrs. Winborne by 
 Miss Smith, daughter of Capt. Orren Smith. The Daughters had 
 charge of the many beautiful flowers with which they covered 
 the last resting place of this good woman and placed thereon the 
 Stars and Bars. 
 
 "A beautiful feature of this exercise was the marching in of the 
 Junior Chapter of Wilson with baskets of flowers singing an 
 appropriate anthem. After the exercise these flowers were placed 
 on the graves of the members of the Wilson Chapter in beautiful 
 Maplewood Cemetery."

 NAME 
 
 The name of this organization shall be the North Carolina Division 
 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the business office 
 shall be the place of residence of the Recording Secretary. 
 
 ARTICLE II 
 
 The objects of the United Daughters of the Confederacy shall be 
 memorial, historical, benevolent, educational and social. 
 
 1st. To honor the memory of those who served, and those v^ho 
 fell in the service of the Confederate States, to protect, preserve and 
 mark places made historic by Confederate valor. 
 
 2nd. To collect and preserve the material for a truthful history 
 of the War Between the States, and to see that the same is taught 
 in our schools, also to record the part taken by Southern women in 
 patient endurance of hardship and patriotic devotion during the 
 struggle, as in untiring efforts after the war, during the recon- 
 struction of the South. 
 
 3rd. To fulfill the sacred duty of benevolence towards the sur- 
 vivors, and towards those dependent upon them. 
 
 4th. To assist descendants of worthy Confederates in securing 
 proper education by securing scholarships for them. 
 
 5th. To bring into the organization all women eligible to member- 
 ship, and to cherish the ties of friendship that will bind us in one 
 great organization. 
 
 ARTICLE III 
 
 MEMBERSHIP 
 
 Section 1. Those women entitled to membership are the women 
 who are the widows, wives, mothers, sisters, nieces, grand nieces 
 and lineal descendants of such men as served honorably in the Con- 
 federate Army, Navy or Civil Service, or of those men, unfit for active 
 duty, who loyally gave aid to the Cause. Also Southern women who can 
 give proof of personal service or loyal aid to the Southern Cause 
 during the war, and the lineal descendants or nieces of such women, 
 wherever living. Northern women, having no male relative who 
 served the Confederate States of America in the War Between the

 through this means becoming a member of the United Daughters 
 of the Confederacy, shall have the words "by adoption" placed upon 
 their certificates of membership, and upon the Registrar's books,

 and in all rosters shall be designated as members "by adoption," 
 said members being entitled to all honors and privileges of this 
 Association except that of holding any office in the General Associa- 
 tion, Division or Chapters, except that of transmitting this honor to

 The honor dies with her if she has no children. 
 
 ARTICLE IV 
 
 ORGANIZATION 
 
 Section 1. This organization shall consist of the various Chapters 
 in North Carolina; each Chapter shall be designated by some special 
 name chosen by its members. 
 
 Sec. 2. Seven women in any town or immediate neighborhood in 
 the Division may organize a Chapter by filling out application blanks 
 and signing charter application, and these papers, accompanied by

 General. 
 
 Sec. 3. Each application blank must be signed by one or more

 already exists except by the consent of a majority of the Division 
 Executive Board. 
 
 Sec. 5. No person can be a member of more than one Chapter at

 one Chapter to another. A Chapter may have as many honorary 
 members as it chooses, but they shall not be counted on the roster 
 of the Chapter. 
 
 Sec. 6. Only members in good standing shall be entitled to an 
 official transfer of membership by dimit from one Chapter to another. 
 A dimit presented within one year shall establish her membership

 PRESIDENT'S REPORT 
 
 To the North Carolina Division, United Daughters of the Confed- 
 eracy, in Convention Assembled: 
 Daughters: Just a short summer vacation, and again we are 
 together. In miles I have been far away from you, and yet nearer 
 than you knew. When I watched the sun set on the Golden Gate 
 and marveled at the handiwork of God, revealed in His great mas- 
 terpiece, the Grand Canyon; wandered through the old Missions of 
 California, through the orange and citron groves, where the whole 
 earth was covered with myriads of bright-hued blossoms and radiant 
 sunshine, and passed out "into the land that listens, into the land 
 that broods, steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods; 
 into a land where the mountains are nameless and the rivers all 
 run God knows where," each of you went with me; and over the old 
 Skagway trail, made fomous by the miners of '98. to the head waters 
 of the Yukon where they searched for their gold, I carried in my 
 hand the U. D. C. Constitution and the records of your golden deeds, 
 and knew that I had found in you and your future work pure gold 
 unalloyed.

16 Minutes of the Tiventy-third Annual Convention 
 
 If I had not made reservations some months before my election, 
 I would not have left the State, realizing that these five short 
 months, due to unusual circumstances, represented my first term 
 of office. However, during my absence I was able to keep in close 
 touch with the Division, being ably assisted at all times by your 
 First Vice-President, Recording Secretary and Corresponding Sec- 
 retary. 
 
 When you elected me to this honored office I realized that the 
 honor was also to one whose love and interest had long been yours. 
 In the years of inactivity which brought increasing weakness, never 
 did her interest in you, some of her best friends and co-workers, 
 and in the work of the United Daughters of the Confederacy wane. 
 
 The beautiful tributes of love and the kind words of sympathy 
 from the Division and Chapters, at the time of God's renewal of 
 eternal life, have warmed the hearts of her children to you. May 
 I serve you as she would have me, knowing that one cannot truly 
 serve until they learn that "he who would be chiefest among you 
 must be servant of all." 
 
 The first and one of my most pleasant official duties was to 
 attend the District Meeting at Pollocksville. A feature of the occa- 
 sion, which added much to its pleasure, was a reunion of the Con- 
 federate Veterans and the boys who, after months of service, had 
 just reached home. 
 
 My own Chapter, which has held my devoted interest ever since 
 its organization twenty years ago, honored me on Memorial Day 
 and gave me the opportunity to bring a message from our Division 
 to the Veterans, and to our boys who were then returning in num- 
 bers from service at home and overseas. 
 
 As your President, I was invited as an honor guest to attend 
 the largest gathering of Club Women ever held in our State, when 
 the Mid-Biennial Council of the General Federation of Women's 
 Clubs met in Asheville, May 27th-31st, and to extend greetings from 
 our Division to the three hundred women representing every State 
 in the Union, who were assembled in harmony of purpose at a 
 luncheon given at Grove Park Inn. 
 
 The following week greatings were carried to the State Federa- 
 tion of Women's Clubs, held at Hendersonville. Both occasions 
 will ever remain pleasant milestones on the road of memory. 
 
 An invitation was extended by the Daughters of the Revolution 
 to be present at the unveiling of a Tablet to Col. Jonas Johnson by 
 the North Carolina Historical Commission and the Board of Com- 
 missioners of Edgecombe County, on May 30th, but being in Ashe- 
 ville, I was unable to accept. 
 
 At the time of the Confederate Veterans' Reunion, I was in Vic- 
 toria, British Columbia, and therefore unable to attend the meet- 
 ing at Rocky Mount. However, a telegram was sent to General

 Metts, expressing the love and affection of this Division for the 
 Veterans and our interest in their welfare. Your First Vice- 
 President was present, and formally extended to them greetings 
 from you. 
 
 Early in my administration a conference was had with Ck)l. 
 Bennehan Cameron regarding the unveiling of the Tablets to Gten- 
 erals Ransom and Pettigrew, at Winchester. As a result of this 
 conference a committee was appointed from the North Carolina 
 Confederate Veterans Association, the North Carolina Historical 
 Commission and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to 
 arrange a program in detail. 
 
 This ceremony, according to the resolution of this Division, was 
 to have been held at Winchester, July 17, 1919, the anniversary 
 of General Pettigrew's death. Unfortunately, the unveiling had to 
 be indefinitely postponed because it was ascertained that if certain 
 columns that had been donated were used, an additional expense 
 of $1,000 would be incurred; but it is hoped that this money will 
 soon be available, and the program carried out as planned. 
 
 The responsibility for the future growth of this Division rests 
 largely with the District Directors, and this responsibility cannot 
 be too strongly emphasized. There are numerous points in the 
 State not represented in our Chapter roll, and yet sufficiently large 
 to justify the formation of a Chapter. It is hoped that, during the 
 coming year, every District Director will carefully investigate each 
 locality in her District where, in her opinion, a Chapter should 
 be formed, and that she will use every effort to establish one at 
 such points. It is one of our duties and obligations to bring into 
 our organization all women eligible to membership, and to cherish 
 the ties of friendship that bind them together. Our President 
 General has stressed this, saying that the highest duty of each 
 Chapter during 1919 is to secure an increase in membership. If 
 the United Daughters of the Confederacy has been able to accom- 
 plish so much with fifty-nine thousand members, what could it not 
 do for a reunited country to-day with double that number? 
 
 Confederate History can best be preserved through our children, 
 and to them we must look for the future welfare and progress of 
 our organization. I cannot too earnestly urge upon you the forma- 
 tion of Children's Chapters, and the encouragement of those already 
 formed. 
 
 Let us keep them ever mindful of and thankful for their birth- 
 place and glorious heritage, and strive to increase their love for 
 a land whose memories are sweet and sacred, and whose traditions 
 inspire in them a love of country. 
 
 I would further urge upon Chapter Presidents the advisability 
 of a constant watch in order that, as soon as a member of a 
 Children's Chapter is eligible, she be invited to apply for mem-

 bership in the Mother Chapter. In this way our membership will 
 be increased and their interest so quickened that they will better 
 perform their part in the larger woman's world of opportunity 
 which will be opened to them. 
 
 While only five months have elapsed since we last came together. 
 112 Membership Certificates have been signed and application for 
 one Charter received from Nashville, N. C. 
 
 Due to the disorganized condition of the publishing industry, 
 there was a delay in the publication of the Minutes of the Wilson 
 Convention, which to some may have appeared inexcusable. It 
 is unquestionably true that much embarrassment to our work has 
 resulted from a failure to get them out promptly, but circum- 
 stances, over which the Recording Secretary had no control, were 
 entirely to blame. 
 
 A letter from the President General was received, requesting 
 that attention be called to the change in the General Constitution 
 regarding registration. A copy of these changes was printed and 
 mailed to each Chapter. Your attention is again called to these 
 requirements, as a compliance will greatly facilitate the work of 
 our Registrar. 
 
 The Confederate Veteran, your oflBcial organ, deserves your 
 hearty support; it cannot faithfully do its duty unless it has this. 
 In future, under a plan agreed upon, all material from State 
 Editors will go directly to our official U. D. C. Editor. Mrs. Alexan- 
 der White. Nashville, Tenn., who will condense, classify and 
 arrange it. 
 
 At the last General Convention a prize of $100.00 was offered 
 for the best paper on Peace, open to pupils of High and Prepara- 
 tory Schools, and at the request of Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, 
 Chairman of the Peace Comimitlee appointed by that Convention, a 
 committee has been appointed to conduct this contest in our 
 Di\ision. 
 
 At the Louisville Convention a committee, representing the 
 U. D. C, was appointed to assist in the publication of the book, 
 "Southern Women in War Work." At that time it was antici- 
 pated that the book could be published at 75 cents a copy, and 
 retailed at $1.50, the profit on sales by each Division to be the 
 property of that Division. The North Carolina Division pledged 
 $125.00 for 167 copies. Later it was found advisable to use a 
 higher grade of paper, and to have the book published by Messrs. 
 George Putnam & Sons Co., of New York, thus securing the pres- 
 tige of the Putnam imprint and its publication in all first-class 
 catalogues, this necessitating an increase in cost to $1.06 
 per copy. The President (Jeneral submitted this decision to this 
 Division, asking whether or not it would consent to take 157 
 copies at the increased price. The question was laid before our

 Executive Board, and it was decided to accept them, thereby 
 increasing our pledge to $166.42. 
 
 In company with a member of the Purchasing and Advisory 
 Committee of the Soldiers' Home, a visit was made to the Home. 
 I talked with many of the Veterans, both in the Home and in the 
 Hospital, and was impressed with the neatness and comfort sur- 
 rounding them, and with the wholesome food provided. 
 
 "Not for fame, not for place, not for rank, not lured by any 
 ambition or goarded by necessity but in simple obedience to duty as 
 they understood it, these men suffered all, sacrificed all, dared all, 
 and died." 
 
 Now that their years are falling heavily upon them, remember 
 to keep them cheered and comforted by the knowledge that their 
 sons and grandsons hold them in honor, and point with pride to 
 their glorious deeds. 
 
 Of their sons and grandsons it has been said: 
 
 "They saw not clearly, nor understood. 
 But, yielding their will the master-hand. 
 Each played his part as best he could, 
 And played it through as the author planned." 
 
 Our Veterans are fast passing away and soon will no longer 
 need our care and attention; nevertheless, in the field of education, 
 there will remain much opportunity for service to later genera- 
 tions. A step in this direction has been taken by the General 
 Division in the establishment of the 1917-'18 Hero Fund, which 
 will stand as a living monument to honor the men of Confederate 
 lineage who served their country in 1917-'18. One application for 
 North Carolina's scholarship, to be established out of this fund, 
 has already been received. 
 
 But my most urgent and heartfelt appeal to you will be for 
 the Confederate Women's Home, for it is the child of this Division. 
 And because I desire to arouse in you a greater interest and a more 
 material support, I am going to tell you at some length of my 
 visit to the Home in company with Mrs. Hunter Smith, Chairman 
 of the Advisory Board. We were met by the Superintendent, Miss 
 Watters, who instantly impressed me with her ability and interest 
 in the work. A visit was made to her well-kept office and to the 
 large dining room, where the tables were made attractive with 
 snowy linen and fresh wild flowers; to the comfortable kitchen, 
 which was neat and clean, and, finally, to the pantry, where Miss 
 Watters told us that at her coming the shelves, which we found 
 almost empty, were well filled, and that never before in the history 
 of the Home had there been such depletion in the storeroom. 
 
 The rooms of the dear old ladies were cozy and well kept. 
 During the rest hour several were visited in their rooms, and were

 most responsive to our words of greeting. Some of them are 
 occupying our Chapter rooms, and would be glad to know members 
 of your Chapters, and to receive attention and remembrances from 
 them. Later, in the comfortable living room, a good many were 
 assembled, and it was a pleasure to linger and talk with them. 
 
 The water supply is very scarce, as the present system of obtain- 
 ing it is nqt, and never has been, sufficient for the demand. Often 
 it has to be hauled quite a distance for bathing and other purposes, 
 and the lack of it is severely felt. 
 
 From the windows of the second story we were shown a small 
 clearing near a group of pines, and were told that here the dear 
 old ladies loved to walk and sit, and call it their park. With 
 small expenditure it could be made an attractive spot, but the 
 little clearing was God's Acre, and there several of their number 
 had been laid to rest for all time. It will be used by many as a 
 last resting place. No markers, mothing, as yet to hallow and 
 make beautiful this sacred spot. 
 
 One of the great needs of the Home is the services of a trained 
 nurse, when necessary. The Superintendent and her assistant are 
 doing everything that is humanly possible, but they cannot properly 
 attend to their many duties and nurse those who are desperately 
 ill. In such cases constant professional care and attention are 
 necessary day and night. 
 
 Daughters, here is the greatest work of our Division, and I 
 most earnestly bespeak your interest in your Confederate Women's 
 Home. Now, at a time when you are laying up stores of good 
 things for yourselves, remember that empty storeroom. The 
 demands which, during the past two years, you so admirably met, 
 are no longer laid upon you, and the doing of them has taught 
 that much can be accomplished by united effort and individual 
 desire; so again I appeal to you to give thought as Chapters and 
 Daughters of the Confederacy to the care and comfort of those 
 who are so dependent upon you, not alone for their pleasures and 
 comforts, but even for the necessities of life. 
 
 In spite of the high cost of living, no additional appropriation 
 was given by the last Legislature, and they are attempting to live 
 on the same annual appropriation of $5,000 given when the Home 
 was first opened. Will not the Chapter Presidents see their repre- 
 sentatives before the extra session of the Legislature next July 
 and try to induce them to pledge their support to an increased 
 appropriation for the Home? 
 
 A splendid history has been made by Southern Womanhood, 
 much of it in the days of 1861-'65 and in the years that followed, 
 and this history is our priceless heritage. Their courage, devotion 
 and sacrifice inspired us as we labored for our reunited country 
 in the hour of its peril.

 And now that peace has been restored to our land and the world 
 is meeting the problems of another reconstruction, our plans and 
 purposes must be broadened. The United Daughters of the Con- 
 federacy will accept this new responsibility and, with its watch- 
 word, "Go Forward," find its place in this new world.

 RECORDING SECRETARY'S REPORT 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 Though only the few summer months separate this Convention 
 from the one held in Wilson, quite an amount of work has passed 
 through my hands. I have sent out 71 letters, 170 cards, 1,162 
 application blanks and 101 other blanks. 
 
 The delay in getting out the Minutes necessitated my making 
 copies of the Chapter Presidents and Children's Leaders for several 
 State officers. At the request of Mr. R. D. W. Connor, Secretary 
 of the North Carolina Historical Commission, I forwarded him a 
 full typewritten list of the Division officers and all Chapter officers. 
 
 The unavoidable delay in getting out the Minutes has been the 
 only shadow in my two years of work, but I feel assured you will 
 understand and overlook the inconvenience caused you and exon- 
 erate both the printer and me when I tell you the delay was caused 
 by strikes and want of efficient labor. 
 
 For mailing out and other expenses attached to getting out 
 Minutes I secured $35.00 from the Treasurer, which I expended 
 as follows, with a balance of $14.43 returned to the Treasurer: 
 
 Mailing Minutes $15.29 
 
 Express on Minutes 5.28

 The time is fast drawing near for me to turn over the Secre- 
 tary's work to my successor. Before I cease to be your Recording 
 Secretary, I must thank you each and all for the great honor you 
 conferred on me in giving me this office. It fills my heart with 
 gladness to think you had that confidence in me. Through years 
 to come many an hour will be made brighter by the memory of 
 the past two years, with its work, which was so gladly done for 
 the cause and the remembrance of the friends I have found and 
 their cheery of mouth and pen. The honor you have conferred 
 upon me I feel was a tribute to both my grandfathers, who so 
 loyally and faithfully served the Confederacy. For them, as well 
 as for myself, I thank you. 
 
 Life is sweet as it is, but oh! so much sweeter when it is full of 
 friends like you. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Nannie M. Gray. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams, with complimentary words, moved 
 that the report be accepted with thanks. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Walter F. Wo'odard, First Vice-President, who took 
 the place of the President during her absence in the summer, 
 read her report. 
 
 FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT'S REPORT 
 
 Madame President and Members of the N. C. Division, U. D. C: 
 
 In coming to you with a report your First Vice-President feels 
 that she has been peculiarly fortunate in being able to serve the 
 Division in even a few instances. 
 
 When advised by our President of her intended absence from 
 the State for several weeks, and of her willingness and desire to 
 leave the Division's affairs in my hands, I felt keenly her faith 
 in me and accepted the trust, pledging my best service in your 
 behalf. 
 
 My first oflScial act was in response to the President General, 
 Miss Poppenheim's appeal that our pledge of $125.00 for the pub- 
 lication of "Southern Women in War Work" be increased one-third. 
 I communicated with every member of the Executive Board, all of 
 whom, except one, replied. It was unanimous, with the one excep- 
 tion, that we raise the pledge made by Mrs. Thrash at Louisville, 
 since the question involved should be one of profit and not of 
 cost to the Division. 
 
 While regretting exceedingly her absence, I was very happy to 
 represent our President at the Fourteenth District Meeting, at

 Spring Hope, on July 10th, delivering her message and making 
 her appeal for the Confederate Woman's Home with splendid 
 results. 
 
 The history of this District which gained two new Chapters last 
 year, and of the John W. Bryant Chapter, of Spring Hope, which 
 organized in September, 1918, with sixteen members, and ten 
 months later, with a membership of forty-eight, entertained the 
 District, will be given in other reports, but I cannot forego an 
 opportunity to commend the District for its zeal, nor the John W. 
 Bryant Chapter for its splendid enthusiasm and beautiful enter- 
 tainment. 
 
 The greatest joy that could have come to me as First Vice- 
 President was in representing the Division at the Reunion of the 
 N. C. Confederate Veterans, at Rocky Mount, when they were so 
 splendidly entertained by the Bethel Heroes, August 5th-7th. 
 
 Again our President, whose mind and heart were always with 
 her Division, sent loving greetings to our beloved veterans. 
 
 The Reunion, with its large attendance, delightful social features, 
 perfect in every detail, was of unbounded joy to the Boys of the 
 Sixties, who related their war experiences in language more thrill- 
 ing than do the boys who broke the Hindenburg Line. 
 
 Elaborately planned and splendidly executed, the Reunion was 
 an evidence of the real love of the Bethel Heroes for our Con- 
 federate fathers. 
 
 It was my duty and sorrowful privilege to send a floral design, 
 with the love and sympathy of the Division, for the funeral of our 
 Honorary Vice-President, Mrs. Leo D. Heartt, who passed away 
 in Raleigh, July 12th. 
 
 With great love for the cause which we represent, and an 
 earnest prayer for the prosperity of the Division, 
 Respectfully submitted,

 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved: 
 
 "As your State President or Recording Secretary, I instituted 
 the Sinking Fund for one, and one purpose only, and I make the 
 motion that the money in the Sinking Fund shall not be drawn 
 out for any purpose except to meet any deficit in the Treasurer's 
 books." 
 
 Motion seconded and carried. 
 
 Mrs. L. E. Fisher, Registrar, read her report. 
 
 REGISTRAR'S REPORT 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 It is my pleasure to bring to you a report on the membership 
 of the Division covering my term of office from May 1st to October 
 1st. There have not been as many registries as are usually made 
 during the same length of time during the winter months because 
 of the fact that the period embraced in this report includes the 
 summer months, which are observed as a vacation season by all 
 the Chapters. 
 
 This report shows a much smaller number of members than was 
 given at the convention at Wilson in April. This decrease is not 
 explained by deaths or transfers, but by the fact that the Chapters 
 of the Division have had a general weeding out of old names car- 
 ried for years with no benefit. I issued a card on September 1st, 
 asking each Chapter to send me a revised list of their roll. Fifty- 
 seven responded, these being indicated in this report by a star. 
 This report carries the accurate number of members of the Chap- 
 ters that sent in their lists. The other Chapters could only be 
 reported by the last minutes, which I followed, adding any new 
 members that I have registered. One hundred and twelve applica- 
 tions have been registered since May 1st. Two new members have 
 been gained by dimits from other States. Two new Chapters, with 
 seven members each, have been added to our Division, these being 
 the Nash Chapter at Middlesex, and the Fannie Patton Chapter at 
 Asheville. 
 
 Below is a statement of the membership by Chapters, showing 
 105 active Chapters with 5,213 members:

 RECORDER OF CROSSES' REPORT. 
 
 * Lenoib, N. C, Oct. 6, 1918. 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 There are many organizations, but above them all and dearer to 
 my heart stands our own North Carolina Division of the United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy. The work of the past two years has 
 indeed been a pleasure, perhaps not so much the work itself, as 
 it is unavoidably tedious and requires absolute accuracy, but it is 
 always a pleasure to honor our veterans at any cost and to serve 
 the U. D. C. in every way possible.

 From October, 1918, to October, 1919, forty-four Crosses of Honor 
 were bestowed, being two more than the previous year. May I 
 urge Chapter presidents to read carefully the rules and regulations 
 governing the bestowal of crosses. If they will do so it will save 
 themselves and my successor a world of "mental anguish" and 
 annoying delays. 
 
 Hundreds of these crosses have been bestowed, but we earnestly 
 trust that the daughters will see that every veteran in North Caro- 
 lina will receive this well-earned token of honor. 
 
 All expenses for the past two years have been gladly borne by 
 your Recorder.

 Since becoming your State Historian I have given the work my 
 first thought and consideration, and for the work have had high 
 ambitions. Some hopes I cherished, have failed to materialize; two 
 I will mention here. The first was that we might have present at 
 this meeting our Historian-General, Mrs. Ann Bachman Hyde; the 
 other was that I might secure for the State a long lost treasure — • 
 the fiag of the 16th Regiment, North Carolina State Troops, which 
 was never surrendered and is now in the possession of Mr. Emanuel 
 Rudisill, of Sherman, Tex. Mr. Rudisill, a soldier of Gaston County, 
 North Carolina, was color bearer at the time of surrender; this 
 flag was sewed into the lining of the coat which Mr. Rudisill wore 
 home, and it is his pride that the flag was never surrendered. I 
 have written repeatedly and have had veterans of my county write 
 Mr. Rudisill to send or bring this flag, that it might be presented 
 to State at this meeting, but not a word have I had from him. 
 
 Though I have failed in some of my ambitions, I am glad so much 
 has been accomplished this year. In our Division for the year we 
 have three contests of our own, due to the generosity of some of 
 our faithful daughters. The Martha Glenn Loving Cup, given by 
 Mrs. S. A. Kindley, is being contested for again by Chapters who

 have best historical report. Mrs. Thomas W. Wilson again offers 
 the ten dollar gold piece to the Chapter sending in the best remi- 
 niscence of a woman of the Confederacy. 
 
 Mrs. W. T. Love offers a ten dollar gold piece to the Chapter send- 
 ing in the best reminiscence by a Confederate Veteran. A number 
 of reminiscences have come in and were duly forwarded to judges 
 to decide on their merits. Some splendid papers came in too late 
 to enter this year's contest and will be kept on file for same next 
 year. A good suggestion from J. E. B. Stuart Chapter, Fayetteville, 
 is a museum for war relics. Let us give this work our attention. 
 The idea of preserving material in scrap books is a fine one. Sev- 
 eral Chapters reported these. 
 
 I have written during the year one hundred postal cards, seventy 
 letters, twenty-four post cards, and mailed out one hundred report 
 blanks.

 Report 
 
 In closing I wish to thank you for your hearty co-operation, 
 consideration, and encouragement. We have a glorious history to 
 preserve. I feel the interest is growing as years go by in this won-

 home Chapters new zeal and encouragement to those who cannot 
 come to Conventions, but who may help in a large measure to fill 
 our store house of knowledge — bits gathered here and there to leave 
 to the future citizens of our dear old North State.

 REPORT OF THE CHILDREN OF CONFEDERACY OF THE 
 NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION. 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 It is my pleasure to bring to you again the report of the C. of C. 
 I find in a majority of the Chapters renewed interest and enthu- 
 siasm; many new members have been enrolled since convention. 
 I am glad to say a new Chapter has been organized of boys alone, 
 also a company of boys have been added to one of our regular 
 Chapers.

 It is very encouraging to know that the catechism is being taught 
 more than at any time for the past few years, as I have more calls 
 for them since convention in May than all of last year. We have 
 now registered 811 names. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mbs. L. T. Townsend, 
 Director of the C. of C. of the N. C. Division. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams moved that the report' be accepted. 
 Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Harvey asked that Capt. C. D. Dowd, Mr. W. C. Gibson 
 and Colonel Melton, Confederate Veterans who were present, 
 come to the front and be introduced. 
 
 Mrs. Harvey called for report of the Executive Committee 
 which met in Wilson in 1919. The report was read by the 
 Secretary. 
 
 EXECUTIVE MEETING 
 
 Wilson, N. C, May 2, 1919. 
 The Executive Committee of the North Carolina Division, United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy, met at the home of Mrs. Graham 
 Woodard, in Wilson, the morning of May 2, 1919, called by the new 
 President, Mrs. C. Felix Harvey, that the new and old members 
 might become acquainted and to discuss the Division work. It was 
 unanimously decided by the board to invite Mrs. Charles R. Hyde, 
 Historian General, to attend the High Point Convention, October 
 8-10, 1919. After a pleasant hour the motion was made to adjourn.

 REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 
 
 The Executive Committee of the North Carolina Division, United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy, met with Mrs. J. F. Hayden, at her 
 home, at 2.30 o'clock, October 7, 1919. 
 
 The Committee was called to order by the President, every mem- 
 ber being present. Business was immediately taken up, and the 
 following recommendations of the President were read and adopted: 
 
 Recommendation I. — That the list of Delegates attending con- 
 vention be published in back of Minutes. 
 
 Mrs. E. M. Williams moved that presidents or Chapter dele- 
 gates hand names of delegates present t'o Recording Secretary 
 by Thursday, noon, for the Minutes. Seconded and carried.

 Recommendation II. — That Residential Addresses of OflBcers, 
 Chairmen and District Leaders be printed in the Minutes when the 
 size of the town warrants it. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that this recommendation be 
 adopted. Seconded and carried. 
 
 Recommendation III. — Realizing the inspiration and the value of 
 song, and that our Southern Melodies should be more familiar to 
 our organization, it is recommended during the convention assem- 
 bled, that we have a time set apart for said songs; that they be 
 rendered by the entire delegation, under the direction of a musical 
 director. 
 
 Mrs. Finger, of Charlotte, moved that this be adopted with 
 the addition that' the musical director be "appointed by the 
 President." Motion carried. 
 
 Recommendation IV. — That during the year 1919 and 1920 there 
 be a special drive for membership, emphasizing the ages from 18 
 to 25. During the recent war our active organization gained inter- 
 national fame through our ready response to all calls. Increased 
 membership gives us more power. Realizing this our President 
 offers a prize for the coming year to the Chapter showing the largest 
 increase in membership. 
 
 After much discussion it was decided to leave this Kesolu- 
 tion as adopted by the Executive Board. 
 
 Recommendation V. — That the District Leaders be authorized to 
 organize Chapters where none now exist, keeping within the bonds 
 of their respective Congressional Districts. 
 
 Mrs. W. F. Woodard moved that it be adopted, wit'h the 
 change of words from "Congressional Districts" to "U. D. C. 
 Districts." 
 
 Then followed the recommendations of the Executive Com- 
 mittee, which were adopted by the Board and are as follows: 
 
 Recommendation VI. — It is recommended that the number of 
 copies published of the Minutes be lessened to a number sufficient 
 to provide a copy for each of the Executive Boards, two copies to 
 every active Chapter in the State, reserving about one hundred 
 copies for special use, which may be purchased by Chapters desiring 
 them. 
 
 Mrs. Eeade moved the adoption. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that the recommendation be 
 amended by inserting the words "and a copy to each General 
 Officer." Carried.

 Recommendation VII. — That the Chapters pay a stipulated sum 
 to liquidate the debt incurred by pledges for the purchase of the 
 books "Southern Women in War Work." 
 
 Following the reading of this recommendation Mrs. Jacksie 
 Daniel Thrash explained that at Louisville Mrs. R. E. Little 
 and Mrs. Philip Holt, representing the Division, pledged to 
 buy one hundred and twenty-five dollars worth of the books 
 "Southern Women in War Work," with fifty dollars paid by 
 the Children's Chapter of Rocky Mount, which Mrs. Holt paid 
 on the floor, and that since then the Executive Board increased 
 the amount seventy-five dollars in order to get better paper and 
 better printers. This raised the pledge to one hundred sixty- 
 six dollars and seventy-two cents ($166.72), with fifty dollars 
 paid and one-third of the balance guaranteed by the Children's 
 Chapter of Rocky Mount, the Chapters to have the privilege 
 of buying these books at one dollar and six cents and sell them 
 for one dollar and fifty cents, retaining the profit in the Chap- 
 ter, After this explanation Mrs. Walter F. Woodard stated: 
 "This is a just debt and I move the adoption of this resolution." 
 
 Seconded and carried.

 Mrs. J. M. Gudger Asheville 
 
 Mrs. Chas. W. Tillett Charlotte

 Mrs. B. H. Griffin Raleigh 
 
 Mrs. E. Ef. Marston Kinston 
 
 Mrs. W. O. Spencer Winston-Salem 
 
 Mrs. Raymond Dunn Enfield 
 
 Mrs. J. H. Anderson Fayetteville 
 
 Mrs. Griffin asks if it was in order that recommendations be 
 made from the floor. The President stating that it was, Mrs. 
 Griffin made the following recommendation : 
 
 "I recommend that the reports from the Chapters be turned 
 in to the District Chairman and she decide the best two, and 
 these be read to the Convention, as we seldom have time to 
 read all reports at the Conventions." 
 
 After much discussion Mrs. F. M. Williams moved: 
 
 "I move that hereafter the Committee and Chapter reports 
 be read alternately every other year." 
 Seconded and carried.

 Moffitt, Mrs. William Dorsey Pender, Mrs. Bryan Grimes, Mrs. 
 "W. P. Eoberts, Mrs. T. J. Jarvis, Mrs. John Thorpe and Miss

 Burkheimer. The Secretary stated that at the time of Mrs. 
 Burkheimer's great sorrow she wrote and expressed to her the 
 heart'-felt sympathy of the Division. 
 
 Mrs. Jacksie Daniel Thrash moved that greetings be tele- 
 graphed the Confederate Veterans at Atlanta, and greetings of 
 sympathy be telegraphed the President, Woodrow Wilson, in 
 his illness. Seconded and carried.

 FIRST DAY — Afternoon Session 
 
 The President, Mrs. Harvey, called the Convention t'o order 
 at 2 : 40 o'clock. 
 
 Mrs. Brooks read the Educational Committee report. 
 
 REPORT OF EDUCATION COMMITTEE, 
 
 NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION, UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE 
 
 CONFEDERACY. 
 
 Madam President and Members of the North Carolina Division, 
 United Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 "Fifth and lastly," as the preachers say, I bring you report of 
 the educational work of our Division, or rather I bring reports 
 of those few Chapters from whom I have been able to extract any 
 information. Only fifteen of the one hundred sent in reports unless 
 there are others still held at Pisgah, where most of them went 
 before being forwarded to Pisgah Forest. So my year's report had 
 to go, on October 1st, to the General Chairman, shamefully meagre. 
 
 Would Chapters report the work any better if blanks were printed 
 in the Minutes, say, on a detachable page just opposite "Things 
 to be Remembered"? Then in convention call a mere reminder to 
 fill in this blank would be all that would be necessary. 
 
 Our $1,250.00 Hero Fund is the pride of the year, and already 
 requests are coming in for its use. We hold three General Scholar- 
 ships this year: one at Agnes Scott, one at the University of Vir- 
 ginia, and one at the University of North Carolina, and we could 
 have had half a dozen more for the asking. 
 
 Our Treasurer tells me that funds for our Division Scholarships 
 at the North Carolina College for Women, have come in well. The 
 James B. Gordon Chapter, Winston-Salem, supports its own and 
 pays $10.00 towards the other five. All of these and the Elvira 
 Worth Moffltt Loan have been filled and applied for for next year. 
 Trinity was filled and then relinquished, and so was Oxford. War-

 rington and Trinity (for girls) were applied for, but not filled. 
 Passifern and Davenport had no eligible applicant. The only Dis- 
 trict Scholarships reported were in the First District, the Thad. 
 W. Thrash Memorial at Christ School, and one in music at Daven- 
 port College, Lenior. And the only Chapters reporting were Albe- 
 marle, one $50.00; Charlotte, one $186.00; Erevard, three $67.00; 
 Durham, one $50.00, and Graham, one $50.00, besides Winston- 
 Salem, already mentioned. 
 
 Medals were reported only from Asheville and Gastonia, two por- 
 traits presented by Albemarle and two by Gastonia, and books to 
 libraries or soldiers by Brevard, $100.00; Dunn, $2.50; Goldsboro, 
 $150.00, Graham, $1.50. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Annie Jean Gash, 
 Chairman Education Committee, 
 North Carolina Division, U. C. D. 
 
 Moved and seconded that this report be accepted. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Harvey announced that Miss Gash be sent a telegram 
 regretting her inability to attend. 
 
 It was stated that Mrs. R. E, Little, who is attending the 
 Confederate Reunion at Atlanta, had asked that the subject of 
 turning over the Confederate Cemeteries to the United States 
 Government be taken up and that she, Mrs. Little, be wired 
 the decision. Rev. Mr. Love, a descendant of a Union soldier, 
 and the G. A. R.'s are desirous of presenting this matter to 
 Congress, and wish the endorsement of the I^orth Carolina 
 Division of the U. D. C. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams therefore made the following motion : 
 
 "I move that the North Carolina Division of the United Daugh- 
 ters of the Confederacy go on record as expressing appreciation of 
 Mr. Love's movement recently endorsed by the Veterans of North 
 Carolina at their Reunion in Rocky Mount, August 5, 6 and 7, 
 1919." 
 
 Motion seconded and carried. 
 
 Mrs. Winstead, of Rocky Mount, requested that we not let 
 ancther year pass as long as a Veteran is able to attend, with- 
 out a State Reunion as long as there are enough Veterans to 
 attend. 
 
 Mrs. B. H. Griffin asked that Mrs. F. M, Williams reconsider 
 her motion of the morning session in regard to the reading of 
 reports. Mrs. Williams consenting, the motion was tabled.

 REPORT OF THE CONFEDERATE WOMEN'S HOME. 
 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 Again it is my privilege to bring to you the report of the Con- 
 federate Women's Home. I will make my report brief, having so 
 recently reported my work at Wilson. 
 
 The Reaper has again entered our Home, and two of the golden 
 grain have passed away — Mrs. Register and Miss Virginia Lilly, 
 who was the first guest of our Home, a lady of the old school, and 
 from one of the best families of the State. She took a pride in 
 the Home and its welfare, and now sleeps in the whispering pines 
 in sight of the Home. 
 
 The most important point I would stress at this convention is 
 inadequate means to run the Home and care for the wives and 
 descendants of the '60. The small sum of $5,000.00 to run an insti- 
 tution for all purposes you can readily see is impossible, and a dis- 
 grace to the sons of women on the Appropriation Committee, whose 
 mothers suffered and endured to raise them up, to be a blessing to 
 suffering humanity, who compel the Home to exist by such a meager 
 appropriation when asked to appropriate an amount sufficient for 
 them to live upon. And it is to you. Daughters, to whom they look 
 for protection and comfort, and they feel assured of your protecting 
 care from the loyal and substantial support you have given them 
 in the past. 
 
 Appeal to your Representative and go to Raleigh when the in- 
 creased appropriation is asked for, and see that we get it, for this 
 is women for women. 
 
 The ladies of the Home were much pleased by" a special visit of 
 our President, Mrs. Harvey, this summer, who brought them cheer, 
 and assured them of her interest and support, and left a check for 
 their comfort; and that check has been spent in giving them extras 
 at the table, which otherwise we could not afford.

 The water supply is inadequate, and we need money to meet the 
 need there, which is absolutely necessary. 
 
 One of our number, our efficient District leader, Mrs. L. T. Town- 
 send of Lumberton, has been inspired with noble thought, which she 
 will bring to you later, and which will be far reaching in its good. 
 This Home belongs to women. It is not being maintained for glory, 
 nor for empty rite, nor for material gain — it is for humanity. It 
 is not the wish of taxpayers of North Carolina that funds should 
 be withheld to maintain this Home; therefore see that we get jus- 
 tice. Having achieved, we should not turn hack!

 Mr. C. E. House, of tlie Historical Commission, Raleigh, 
 came before the Convention for the adoption of the following 
 resolutions : 
 
 Whereas, The General Assembly of North Carolina, at its last 
 session passed an act to create a "North Carolina Memorial Building 
 Commission and to provide for the erection of a suitable Memorial 
 Building in honor and to the memory of all North Carolina citizens 
 who gave their lives, services or property to the end that the War 
 with Germany and her allies might be won"; and 
 
 Whereas, In this great crisis of the world's history the sons and 
 daughters of North Carolina, inspired by the patriotic spirit of the 
 men of '61, which it has ever been the desire and purpose of the 
 North Carolina Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy 
 to keep alive in the hearts and minds of our people, freely gave, 
 without stint and without limit, of their lives and property in the 
 service of our country; and 
 
 Whereas, It is our desire to manifest in some practical way our 
 appreciation of the patriotism at home and the valor on the battle 
 front of these splendid sons and daughters of the Confederacy; and 
 
 Whereas. Said Memorial Building, when completed, will be the 
 property of the State of North Carolina and will be used as a 
 depository for the historical records and relics of the State from 
 the earliest times, so that it will be in reality a great and useful 
 memorial to the "men of 76" and to the "men of '61," as well as 
 to their descendants of the Great World War; therefore, be it 
 
 Resolved, By this Convention of the United Daughters of the 
 Confederacy of North Carolina that we heartily endorse the plan 
 for the proposed War Memorial; that we pledge to the Memorial 
 Building Commission our co-operation and aid in bringing the 
 matter to the attention of the people of our several communities 
 and in raising the necessary funds; and that the President of this 
 Division be authorized, after consultation with said Memorial Build- 
 ing Commission, to take such action to carry out the purposes of 
 this resolution as she may think proper; and be it further 
 
 Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to forward a copy of 
 this resolution to the Secretary of the said Memorial Building Com- 
 mission. 
 
 Whereas, It is fitting for the United Daughters of the Confed- 
 eracy to honor those who served their country in the late World 
 War equally with those who served their country in the War of 
 the Confederacy; and 
 
 Whereas, It is essential to the honor of those who served in the 
 late World War to preserve their records inviolate to posterity; 
 be it, therefore, 
 
 Resolved, By the North Carolina Division, United Daughters of 
 the Confederacy in convention assembled at High Point, October 
 8th, 1919: 
 
 1. That we do hereby endorse the efforts of the North Carolina 
 Historical Commission to assemble in its archives full records of 
 North Carolina in the World War, and 
 


## p. 58 (#246) #############################################

58 Minutes of the Twenty-third Annual Convention 
 
 2. That we do hereby urge upon all local Chapters of the United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy to appoint a committee to be known 
 as a World War Records Committee, which committee shall co- 
 operate with all agencies of the North Carolina Historical Com- 
 mission in its community in carrying forward this work. 
 
 Mrs. Thrast moved the adoption of the resolutions. Moved 
 and carried. 
 
 Mr. House, in the name of the Historical Commission, ex- 
 tended thanks to the Daughters assembled for their action in 
 the matter. 
 
 Mrs. L. T. Tovmisend asks that she he given a few minutes 
 in which to present a matter of vast importance and which is 
 very close to her heart' and which should be to each and every 
 Daughter of North Carolina, that of providing a trained nurse 
 when necessary for the Women's Confederate Home at Fayette- 
 ville. She stated that a pledge of from three to five dollars for 
 each Mother Chapter and a pledge of from three to five dollars 
 from each Children's Chapter would make this possible. 
 
 Mrs. Reid, of Lenior, moved that the Nurse's Fund be raised 
 in this way. Motion seconded and carried. 
 
 Mrs. Winstead moved that the State tax be raised from fifteen 
 cents to thirty cents per member, but Mrs. F. M. Williams 
 stated that this would not be constitutional, but that each Chap- 
 ter could increase said tax at its discretion. 
 
 It was proposed that the Convention endorse Mrs. McKinnie 
 for President general. Mrs. F. M. Williams stated that this 
 could not be done by the Convention, but' that the Executive 
 Board could do so. Mrs. Harvey then stated that this had 
 already been done and a telegram sent Mrs. McKinnie. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash stated that the General Convention was seek- 
 ing a woman of the highest type and ability for it's Third Vice- 
 Presidency, and that she asked the pleasure of naming Mrs. 
 R. P. Holt of Rocky Mount. Mrs. Thrash further stated that 
 she wished it understood that this was a case of the ofiice seek- 
 ing the woman and not the woman seeking the ofiice. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that the Convention not only 
 endorse Mrs. Holt for the office, but that a large delegation 
 from this Division go to Tampa and push the movement. Sec- 
 onded and carried by a rising vote.

 Mrs. F. M. Williams stated that as t'he pantry is empty at 
 the "Woman's Confederate Home and that since Government 
 food supplies could be bought at such a reduction, she would 
 suggest that each Chapter make an effort to send a box of staple 
 food to the Home. If each Daughter would give one or two 
 cans a bo'x could soon be filled. 
 
 Mrs. Hunter Smith asked that the boxes be sent to the Home 
 and not to her. 
 
 Mrs. Winstead moved that this Division give $1,200.00 for 
 the ISTurse's Fund until the Legislature made appropriate pro- 
 visions for this purpose. Seconded by Mrs. I. W. Faison and 
 carried. 
 
 Mrs. Winstead asked, as a trained nurse will now be provided 
 for the Home, would decrepid, invalid Confederate women be

 REPORT OF WAR RELIEF WORK. 
 
 The Report of the War Relief Work was called for and 
 read by the Director, Mrs. R. P. Holt. Accepted. 
 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 I bring you a short report, but you must realize that to have a 
 good report each Chapter must not only do the work but report 
 it to your chairman. So few have sent in any report. Gastonia 
 was the only one until the last questions were sent out. 
 
 Only twenty-nine Chapters sent any War Records. Now, Daugh- 
 ters, don't you feel enough interest in the boys of your country to 
 want their records kept? No one else is going to tell it to coming 
 generations that your boys were descendants of Confederate Soldiers, 
 and when other sections claim that they sent more boys, how can 
 we answer them if we cannot go to our records? Our boys did 
 their part, now it is with you to do yours. 
 
 I feel that five Chapters should be mentioned for their good work. 
 Ransom-Sherrill. through its President, Mrs. F. M. Williams, has 
 sent in this year 475 War Records; Gastonia, Red Springs, Wilson, 
 and Enfield each sent a goodly number. Do these ladies love their 
 boys and the Confederate Cause more than you? 
 
 You have the blanks for the records for I sent the same to each 
 Chapter, asking you to return them filled out and get as many 
 more as you needed. Now, Daughters, these blanks cost quite a 
 good deal. The first two thousand I gave the Division, the Division 
 has paid for the others. If you are not going to use them, return 
 them so those who want to help keep our records can have them, 
 thereby saving expense. 
 
 I have ready to send Mrs. Rountree eight hundred and seventy- 
 five. Think, if each Chapter had tried it could have sent in almost 
 that many. 
 
 There are still some of the Hero Fund Pledges made at Wilson 
 unpaid, but I am so anxious for North Carolina to go to Tampa 
 with her pledge of $1,250.00 paid I am going to pay the remainder 
 to Mrs. Pless. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. R. p. Holt, 
 Director of War Relief Worfc, Rocky Mount, N. C. 
 
 The report of the Vice-Regent of the ISTorth Carolina Room 
 in Richmond was read bj Mrs. Latta C. Johnston. Accepted. 
 
 Madam President and Daughter's of the Confederacy: 
 
 It is a great pleasure to again be with you after an absence of 
 two years. In that time, however, my interest in the United Daugh- 
 ters of the Confederacy and the North Carolina Room in Confed- 
 erate Museum has not abated. You, dear friends, have continued 
 to manifest your interest in the North Carolina Room in sending, 
 from time to time, things of interest, as well as checks from some 
 of the Chapters. It is found at the Museum, as with everything 
 else, that it takes $2.00 now to do what one used to do, so we are 
 quietly but determined to try to raise our Endowment Fund to 
 $5,000.00, feeling that it requires that much to maintain it. Our 
 eflBcient Vice-Regent, Mrs. J. Allison Hodges, has just written me

 of Confederate Veterans, citing the case of a needy tubercular 
 mountain girl, and made the following motion : 
 
 "I move that we endorse the movement looking forward to the 
 establishment of a bed in the Tubercular Sanitorium, and that the 
 President appoint a committee of three to look into the matter."

 Mrs. H. A. London read the following motion : 
 
 "There is a tradition remembered by the older generation that 
 some of the churches in the South gave their bells to the Confederate 
 Government to be cast into cannon. This is a most interesting piece 
 of history, but it is not generally known what churches or how many 
 thus offered their bells. 
 
 "I, therefore, move that the President of the North Carolina 
 Division appoint a committee to find out what churches offered or 
 gave their bells to the Confederate Government to be cast into can- 
 non, and that this idea be presented to the U. D. C. Convention, 
 as it is too valuable a bit of history to be forgotten." 
 
 Motion seconded and carried.

 DISTRICT REPORTS 
 
 District No. 1 
 
 The seventh annual meeting of the First District North Carolina 
 Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was held at 
 Hendersonville in May. Representatives of only four Chapters were 
 present, but these promised to undertake great things for the Dis- 
 trict. We are trying out having more officers in the organization, 
 and if it proves beneficial hope to propose such a change in Article 
 XI of our State Constitution. Mrs. L. R. Barnwell was elected His- 
 torian, and Miss May Alexander, Secretary, with Miss Gash re- 
 elected Director. The proposition was made that our District offer 
 a banner for the best work done by any District, and we hope this 
 convention will allow us this privilege and decide upon the standard 
 of excellence. 
 
 The Disitrict has two scholarships: one in Music at Davenport 
 College, Lenoir, and the Thad W. Thrash Memorial Scholarship at 
 Christ School, Arden. We are also glad to report the organization 
 of a new and enthusiastic Chapter in Asheville — the Fannie Patton. 
 
 Adjourned t'o meet at call of the Director,

 REPORT OF THE DISTRICT DIRECTOR 
 
 The Chapters which compose the Eleventh District — Red Springs, 
 Lumberton, Raeford, Maxiton, Dunn, St. Paul. Whiteville, Merry Hill, 
 and Fayetteville — met in annual session on Tuesday, July 15th. The 
 place of meeting was "Ardlussa," near Fayetteville, a picturesque old 
 home on the banks of a winding stream, bordered by mountain 
 laurel, a most attractive spot. Delegates from the Chapters came 
 by motor, and at midday were regaled with a bountiful luncheon 
 of fried chicken, beaten biscuits, etc., served a la Southern style. 
 After the roll call and reading of minutes from last meeting, an 
 interesting address was given by Mrs. L. T. Townsend, of Lum- 
 berton, our retiring District Director. Mrs. Townsend emphasized, 
 as a matter of great importance, the need of a fund to procure a 
 trained nurse for the Confederate Woman's Home. The suggestion 
 was unanimously adopted by the meeting, subject to the approval of 
 the State Convention. Reports were given from the Chapters repre- 
 sented, and all showed that the Daughters are now returning with 
 renewed zeal to the memorial, historical, educational and benevo- 
 lent work of our organization since finishing the war work of the 
 pasit two years. All showed substantial donations to every U. D. C. 
 cause. Each Chapter reported contributions to the Flora Macdonald 
 College Scholarship, which is kept up by this District. Mrs. Hunter 
 Smith spoke of the work at the Confederate Woman's Home. After 
 luncheon the election was held for the new District Director, Mrs. 
 John H. Anderson, of Fayetteville, being chosen. A vote of appre- 
 ciation was given Mrs. Townsend for her splendid leadership during 
 the pasIt two years. Mrs. Anderson, Historian of the J. E. B. Stuart

 Chapter, then read an original paper on "Red Cross Work of Fayette- 
 ville Women in the Sixties." Personal reminiscences of those trying 
 times followed this by several of the real Daughters, which were 
 greatly enjoyed. 
 
 This very interesting program closed with songs of the South- 
 land, with Mrs. J. H. Currie at the piano, the entire delegation 
 joining in singing "Dixie," "Honnie Blue Flag," and other songs so 
 dear to our hearts. 
 
 The meeting then adjourned, the place and time of next meeting 
 being left open, while all expressed eagerness to return to "Ard- 
 lussa." 
 
 Since the meeting of the District very satisfactory reports have 
 been received from several of the Chapters, which have met their 
 obligations and have sent donations to the Confederate Home. I 
 am using every means to keep in touch with each Chapter and 
 arouse more interest, and expect to visit them all during the year. 
 Respectfully submitted,

 District Director.

 The Eighth District meeting of the United Daughters of Confed- 
 eracy was held at Roxboro, Person County, September 11, 1919. 
 
 The delegates and visitors were met by a delegation of the local 
 Chapiter and carried to the Club House at Lock Lilly. The building 
 was attractively decorated with Confederate flags and flowers. 
 
 In the absence of the District Leader, Mrs. J. A. Long, President 
 of the local Chapter, presided over the business session. The session 
 was opened with the Lord's Prayer, followed by the singing of 
 "America." Mrs. J. A. Long then welcomed the delegates and 
 visitors. 
 
 Roll Call showed Yanceyville and Hillsboro absent and no report. 
 Leonidas Polk Chapter. Chapel Hill, had no delegate present, but 
 report was read from them, telling of the dinner and parade given 
 on the 10th of May to the Veterans and the returned heroes of the 
 World War. 
 
 Mrs. M. H. Jones, from the Julian S. Carr Chapter, Durham, gave 
 a very interesting report of the war work done by them, also the 
 effort she was making to get the record of each descendant of a 
 Confederate Veteran who died in the World War. 
 
 Mrs. W. H. Harris read a most gratifying report from the Person 
 County Chapter. This County feels quite proud of the Congres- 
 sional Medal awarded to Private Robert L. Blackwell, the son of 
 an old Confederate Veteran, who was killed in France March 6, 
 1919. This was (we are told) the only North Carolinian to receive 
 the Congressional Medal. Only about fifty were received in the 
 United States. 
 
 After the business session the President asked the ladies to lay 
 aside all formality and discuss any question they wished. There 
 were many interesting phases of the work discussed, and among 
 them was the care of our old Veterans and their graves. Mr. Pf. F. 
 Carver made a most interesting talk, urging all counties to erect 
 their Confederate monuments as soon as possible.

 Chapel Hill was selected as the next place of meeting, some time 
 in April. 
 
 We were then invited into the dining-room, and such a dinner 
 has never been seen before. It was a true old-fashioned Southern 
 dinner. After partaking of all the good things we could, the visitors 
 and delegates were invited out on the porch, where they spent a 
 most delightful afternoon. At 6 o'clock they were again invited 
 in the dining-room and served supper (another feast). 
 
 After supper they adjourned to the porch, sang "Dixie" in con- 
 cert (a fitting ending to such a patriotic meeting of women who 
 are willing to do their bit), farewells were said, and each lady 
 said it was one of the most pleasant days they had ever spent.

 Owing to local conditions the Mt. Olive Chapter was compelled 
 to postpone entertainment of the Twelfth District until the fol-

 take this opportunity of impressing upon delegates from this Dis- 
 trict to have a good representation at the spring meeting.

 is now actively engaged in placing markers to fifty Confederate 
 Veterans in their cemetery.

 The Thirteenth District of the North Carolina Division of the 
 United Daughters of the Confederacy reports interest, activity and 
 co-operation in all lines of U. D. C. work. 
 
 Twenty-five new members have been registered. 
 
 A splendid meeting of the District was held at Spring Hope, July 
 10th,. each of the five Chapters and three Children's Chapters being 
 well represented. Interest in the Confederate Woman's Home was 
 paramount. Pledges of material aid were made by all Chapters. 
 
 The District was invited to attend the Reunion of Confederate 
 Veterans at Rocky Mount on August 6th. 
 
 On September 4th representatives of each Chapter were guests 
 of the Confederate Veterans of Edgecombe County at their reunion, 
 and also of the William Dorsey Pender Chapter at their regular 
 meeting on the same day. The frequent interchange of greetings 
 have wrought a splendid feeling of loyalty and co-operation in the 
 District, from which we expect splendid results next year. Mrs. 
 L. L. Staton, of Tarboro, will be our new Director. The next 
 annual meeting will be held with the Bethel Heroes, of Rocky 
 Mount, in April, 1920.

84 Minutes of the Twenty-third Annual Convention 
 SUPPLEMENTAL TO TABULATED REPORTS 
 
 ASHEBORO— RANDOLPH CHAPTER, No. 1031. 
 
 Our report is rather meagre on account of sickness and death 
 in the homes of some of our officers. Also this report is for the 
 time since May 1st, as everything prior to that time was reported 
 at the Wilson meeting. 
 
 ASHEVILLE— ASHEVILLE CHAPTER, No. 104. 
 
 The Asheville Chapter sends greeting to the convention assem- 
 bled in High Point, and submits the following report: Chapter 
 has increased its membership 75 members in two years. Medal 
 won by Miss Sawyer. Subject, "Reconstruction Period of North 
 Carolina." Meetings held regularly and largely attended. The 
 Daughters feel their responsibility in doing their part of the work 
 in the world's great trial during the reconstruction period, and at 
 the same time uppermost in their hearts is the care of the Vet- 
 erans. Combining business with historical and educational pro- 
 grams, our Chapter work has been a real pleasure. Two open meet- 
 ings for the Veterans, one on Memorial Day and the other at the 
 home of the President, the former was featured by two splendid 
 addresses, one by Dr. E. K. McLarty. of Methodist Church, on Lee, 
 and Commissioner Ramsey on Stonewall Jackson. Splendid chicken 
 dinner served to Veterans and wives. 100 in number. The latter, 
 by an exchange of reminiscences and war experiences, as thej' ex- 
 pressed it, had "the time of their lives." Many visiting "real Daugh- 
 ters" were there. Water melon feast, and official photographer from 
 Kenilworth requested the honor of photographing the group. Thir- 
 teen new members since April, 1919. and 8 applications on file. 
 
 Mrs. James M. Gudger, Jr., 
 
 President. 
 
 ASHEVILLE— FANNY PATTON CHAPTER, No. 1699. 
 
 The Fanny Patton Chapter was given its Charter in May, and 
 held its opening meeting on the 30th of May of this year. The 
 Chapter is founded in memory and named for Miss Fanny Patton, 
 a woman of singular nobility of character, first President of the 
 Asheville Chapter. Our membership is small but enthusiastic, and 
 we intend to have a Library of Confederate volumes and to do a 
 great deal of historical work. We sent in 57 pages of historical 
 matter to the State Historian. Also, we have planned a Children's 
 Chapter, and will give all the aid possible to the Veterans and to 
 education. We wish to go on record as standing for all that is 
 finest and best in Confederate tradition and Southern history. We 
 are custodians of the Veteran's Hall, and have assisted them in 
 preparing for the Atlanta Reunion. We have served lunch to them 
 on their monthly meeting day also. 
 
 Martha C. Kepler, 
 
 President.

 KURGAW— PENDER COUNTY CHAPTER, No. 761. 
 
 Very little done since the April convention. Have contributed 
 to the Educational Causes, also the Jefferson Davis Monument. We 
 have given liberal aid to a needy Confederate Veteran, also served 
 dinner to our County Veterans. 
 
 Mrs. J. R. Bannerman, 
 
 President. 
 
 BREVARD— TRANSYLVANIA CHAPTER, No. 1353. 
 
 Besides the contributions listed above Transylvania Chapter sent 
 $5.00 to the Jeff Davis Monument Fund and paid $18 on our build- 
 ing debt. Plans are now being completed for a Halloween Party 
 which will wipe out the debt. Our scholarships at Fruitland and 
 Brevard Institutes have been filled, and 250 books added to our 
 library. Five members attended the District meeting in Hender- 
 sonville. Two names have been dropped from the roll and 3 added. 
 Besides its uses for meetings and as a library and rest room, our 
 Chapter House now serves as office for our County Home Demon- 
 stration Agent. During our "Welcome Home" celebration we might 
 have used the "S. R. O." sign. We also decorated a "float" to 
 carry the Veterans and helped with the serving. Of the 40 Red 
 Cross Service Badges given to women of our County, 4 of the 7 
 highest awards were to Chapter members; 4 of the next 8, and 6 
 of the 25 lowest grade. 
 
 Annie Jean Gash, 
 President Transylvania Chapter. 
 
 CLINTON— ASHFORD-SILLERS CHAPTER, No. 1133. 
 
 With greetings the Asheford-Sillers Chapter submits the follow- 
 ing report: Our monthly meetings have been regularly attended; 
 not taking our usual vacation in August. Have contributed our 
 twenty-five (25) cents per capita for the Jefferson Davis Memorial 
 Fund. Gave the annual celebration and dinner to the Veterans on 
 Memorial Day. On this occasion our Chapter gave to the County 
 a beautiful satin Memorial Service Flag, emblazoned with twenty- 
 five golden stars, representing Sampson's gift of twenty-five noble 
 boys to "Freedom's Cause" in 1918-1919. Since the Wilson Conven- 
 tion our chief work has been collecting the War Records for Mrs. 
 Holt. Have sent in sixteen, but have many more to send. Our boys 
 on their return quickly scattered, and it is difficult to reach them. 
 Our financial report looks small, but the bulk of this was reported 
 at the spring meeting. 
 
 Mrs. Henry A. Grady, 
 
 President. 
 
 CHAPEL HILL— LEONIDAS POLK CHAPTER, No. 556. 
 
 On the 10th of May Memorial Day was celebrated as never before 
 in Chapel Hill. The Confederate Veterans and the Daughters united 
 in making the occasion a grand welcome to the heroes of the 
 World War. The entire community and countryside joined us most

 heartily, and such a crowd as Chapel Hill had never seen before 
 assembled to do honor to our soldiers. 
 
 We have just given $25.00 to the Educational Fund, 
 We have offered two prizes to the school children for the best 
 papers on subjects relating to the war between the States or the 
 Confederacy. We are also interesting the school children in the 
 two medals offered by the North Carolina Division, United Daugh- 
 ters of the Confederacy. We are at work on getting the records 
 of Confederate descendants who took part in the World War. 
 
 CHARLOTTE— STONEWALL JACKSON CHAPTER, No. 220. 
 
 Since the convention at Wilson in April our Chapter has taken 
 its usual summer vacation, and therefore our report does not show 
 many activities. However, we missed only two meetings, and our 
 Benevolent and Memorial Committees were ever on the alert to 
 help and comfort sick and afflicted Veterans. A large gift of his- 
 torical material has been added to the Chapter's scrap-book. We 
 have contributed to "Everywoman's Magazine" a history of the 
 Stonewall Jackson Chapter. The prize offered by Mrs. Eickett for 
 the best essay written by a Veteran was won by our beloved Col. 
 E. A. Osborne. Our Chapter endeavors not only to keep fresh in 
 our minds and hearts the heroic efforts of "Our Boys of '62" who 
 wore the Grey, but with equal enthusiasm and loyalty aided in the 
 celebrations for "Our Boys" who wore the Khaki when, in 1919, 
 they returned from "over there." 
 
 Mrs. C. W. Tillett, 
 
 Acting President. 
 
 DILLSBORO— W. A. ENLOE CHAPTER, No. 1578. 
 (See Statistical Report.) 
 
 DUNN— CHICORA CHAPTER, No. 801. 
 
 This Chapter has a balance of $121.29. One hundred and five 
 dollars, of this money has been paid for board for a Veteran's 
 widow. We hope to put her in Confederate Woman's Home. 
 
 DURHAM— JULIAN S. CARR CHAPTER, No. 355. 
 
 There are three papers being written by Confederate Veterans' 
 wives. Our Historian has written a most interesting article for 
 "Everybody's Magazine." Three markers have been placed at graves, 
 and 15 designs sent. We also gave $13.75 to the Jefferson Davis 
 Monument, and $100.00 to the War Relief Fund.

 the direction of Major "Fighting-Bob" Lamb and our Historian. Mrs. 
 J. H. Anderson, was one of the best ever assembled in Fayetteville 
 on Memorial Day. Our Chapter never loses interest in the guest 
 of the Confederate Woman's Home. We have planned county and 
 town donation days for October 17th and 18th, and as a Chapter to 
 go to the Home early in November and beautify the burial plot.

 to do in the future.

 HENDERSONVILLE— IMARGARET DAVIS HAYES CHAPTER. 
 
 No. 853. 
 
 The Chapter joined with the County in a joint celebration of 
 Confederate Veterans and our soldier boys on June 3rd. A parade 
 was held in which the Veterans received even more honor than the 
 other heroes, and a most elaborate picnic dinner was served in the 
 park. The Daughters had charge of a most successful County 
 reunion of the Veterans on August 14th. A wonderful address by 
 Dr. Powell, of Asheville, and music by the band and dinner in the 
 park made it a memorable day. When the funeral of a Veteran is 
 held in reach, the Daughters attend in a body and an evergreen 
 wreath with a Confederate flag is laid on the cofRn — and usually 
 buried with the fallen hero. 
 
 HERTFORD— PERQUIMANS CHAPTER. No. 789.

 done very little. We have contributed our 25 per capita for the 
 Davis Monument and responded whenever called upon. We expect 
 to take up our educational work this fall. 
 
 LINCOLNTON— SOUTHERN STARS CHAPTER, No. 477. 
 
 Our greatest work is maintaining "Memorial Hall," where we 
 have dinners and social meetings for the Veterans; also a library 
 for the use of the town folk, which is open Saturdays. We organ- 
 ized the "Red Cross" in Lincolnton, and gave the hall for a work 
 room. We try to care for and comfort our old soldiers. 
 
 LUMBERTON— ROBESON CHAPTER, No. 943. 
 
 Our Chapter has made the following subscriptions to the several 
 causes: $6.00 to Flora MacDonald Educational Fund; $10.00 to 
 Davis Memorial Fund; $15.00 to the Hero Fund. All of these have 
 been paid. We have sent a box of food to the Confederate Woman's 
 Home. The membership responds well to all calls.

 MOUNT OLIVE— CONFEDERATE GRAY CHAPTER, No. 834. 
 
 Our work has been out of line this year. The conditions prevented 
 election of officers until April. The Red Cross practically drafted 
 our U. D. C. members, and it is nearly like reorganizing a new 
 Chapter. 
 
 Annie S. Wooten, 
 
 President. 
 
 MURFREESBORO— XORFLEET HARREL CHAPTER, No. 1234. 
 
 Since the State Convention in April our Chapter has not been 
 able to do much active work as its members have been scattered 
 by being out of town. We have met all pledges, paid $8.00 to the 
 Jefferson Davis Monument Fund. Our members have been active 
 as war relief workers, helping both Liberty Bond and War Saving 
 Stamp sales. 
 
 NEW BERN— NEW BERN CHAPTER, No. 204. 
 Paid for Jefferson Davis Monument $33.75. 
 
 FITTSBORO— WINNIE DAVIS CHAPTER, No. 259. 
 
 We have 66 members; have paid our dues and fulfilled all our 
 obligations, besides giving to every Confederate request presented 
 to us. 
 
 The work for our Veterans at home comes first with us always. 
 Then comes the Soldiers' Home and Confederate Woman's Home 
 and educational work. In addition to the work for our Veterans, 
 our U. D. C. is mainly memorial. On a line with this (as I said 
 in my last report) we are aiding in placing Honor Roll Tablets in 
 the schools of Chatham County. These are to contain the names 
 of those men whom the schools have given to the World War. So 
 we have at heart the interest of these young soldiers, sailors and 
 marines, the descendants of those men who "wore the Gray" — the 
 followers of General Lee. We will have a Memorial Tablet in our 
 Court House bearing the names of those men from Chatham who 
 lost their lives during the World War. 
 
 We placed a laurel wreath on the grave of every Confederate 
 soldier at Memorial Day. and when one dies a wreath and flag is 
 sent to place on his grave. 
 
 Of course we did war work, and on July 4th our U. D. C. Float 
 was fine. In front rode an old soldier, his breast covered with 
 badges, and by his side was a young soldier in khaki. Every girl 
 on the float was engaged in either knitting, sewing, spinning, card- 
 ing or picking up lint; there was a point to it perceptible at a 
 glance. 
 
 The older members of the Chapter are asked to tell at Chapter 
 meetings incidents of the war that they remember. We must never 
 let any one speak of "T^e Lost Cause." Our "Cause" was not lost, 
 but has been vindicated in the passing years. 
 
 Our Children's Chapter is growing and the little folks seem to 
 take a great interest in the meetings. 
 
 We had a Reunion Day in August with dinner, and have a fine 
 museum in our Court House for World War relics. 
 
 Mrs. Henry A. London, 
 
 President.

 who are descendants of Confederate Veterans. Our members served 
 nobly on the Welcome Home Day and Confederate Veterans Re-

 pass pleasantly some of the tedious hours. A nice dinner was served 
 the Veterans at the Home on the 10th of May; also the Wake 
 County Veterans were invited to this dinner. We also contributed

 scribed for The Veteran. Sent our 25 cents per member to Jefferson 
 Davis Monument— $29.00. 
 
 At the memorial services the 10th of May we also entertained the 
 returned soldiers. On August 8th and 10th the Bethel Heroes, with 
 the city of Rocky Mount, entertained the United Confederate Vet- 
 erans of the State. This was a glorious occasion. There were in 
 attendance over four hundred Veterans. This has been a wonderful

 ROXBORO— PERSON COUNTY CHAPTER, No. 943. 
 
 During the past year Person County Chapter has grown in in- 
 terest and attendance, and we expect soon to have several new 
 members. We contributed $10.00 to Educational Fund; served din- 
 ner to our Veterans on Memorial Day, and decorated the graves of 
 Veterans with flags and flowers. We feel honored in having the 
 Congressional Medal awarded to a Person County boy, Private 
 Robert L. Blackwell, son of a Confederate Veteran, and who was 
 killed in France, October 8, 1918. We are told that he was the 
 only North Carolinian to receive this medal. We grieve over the 
 death of our second Vice-President, who was loyal and faithful. 
 The meeting of the eighth District was held with our Chapter and 
 was much enjoyed. We are still working on our Monument Fund 
 and hopeful of success.

 Since April Robert F. Hoke Chapter has given $10.00 to Hero 
 Educational Fund, and $18.50 to relief of local Veterans. We have 
 materially aided 5 Veterans in ways other than financial; estab- 
 lished 2 annual prizes: one in High School for best essay on Lee, 
 one in Grammar School for best essay on Jackson. Prizes for 1919 
 were presented at Commencement. Hereafter these awards will be 
 made on Lee and Jackson Day. On May 10th, in collaboration with 
 public schools, we held our usual Memorial Exercises and children 
 banked Confederate Monument and graves of Veterans with flowers. 
 On May 10th we gave our annual Veterans' dinner. As we feared 
 bad weather, the dinner was indoors. The hall looked as though it 
 were decorated for a rose fete, and the Veterans seemed to appre- 
 ciate the beauty of the hall even more than the elaborate and ex- 
 cellent dinner. On July 4th Rowan County celebrated Welcome 
 Home Day for our "Boys of the World War," and we assisted as a 
 Chapter. The Veterans of Confederacy were honor guests of the 
 county on that day; 17 members of Chapter have received Red

 bers have gone to these hospitals many times to assist at enter- 
 tainments for the convalescents. Individual members bought Vic-

 Owing to unsettled conditions Anson Chapter has met but few 
 times, but has kept all dues and pledges paid, has attended many 
 funerals of Veterans, always with an evergreen wreath. The "Old 
 South" is alive, deep-rooted in our hearts, and we endeavor to faith- 
 fully follow its ideals, knowing that these make for the truest 
 service and most lasting. The President of this Chapter has not

 Eleven Crosses of Honor were bestowed. 
 
 WAYNESVILLE— HAYWOOD CHAPTER. No. 940. 
 
 On the 3rd of June which the Chapter celebrates, not only as the 
 birthday of Jefferson Davis, but as Memorial Day, a bountiful dinner 
 was served to Veterans and visitors, after which flowers were car- 
 ried to Green Hill Cemetery where many of our brave soldiers who 
 wore the Gray are sleeping peacefully "under the shade of the trees." 
 Only one Cross of Honor was presented at that time. A most inter- 
 esting address was given by Judge Ferguson, who is an old Veteran. 
 We hope very soon to erect a monument to the memory of our 
 Haywood men who gave their lives for their country. Through the 
 efforts of our representative, the Hon. D. L. Boyd, our Legislature 
 donated $2,000.00 to this worthy cause. The Chapter has on hand 
 a small sum which had been, from time to time, given by friends.

 The Alfred Rowland Chapter sends greetings to the State Con- 
 vention now in session. Our work during the past winter was 
 interrupted by two epidemics of influenza, and as we disband dur- 
 ing the summer our report is a very poor one. The 10th of May 
 was observed as usual. As it was Home Coming Day for World 
 War soldiers, we united with our country in honoring the heroes 
 of both wars. We are glad to report the enrollment of 6 new mem- 
 bers. We have given $2.00 to Scholarship Fund at Flora Mac- 
 Donald College, and $9.50 for gifts to one of our Southern women 
 now residing in the Confederate Home.

 We have endeavored to make of our unit a concrete demonstra- 
 tion of the beauty and utility of Wilsonian Democracy, believing in 
 the self-determination of men and nations and the supreme neces- 
 sity of Article X. It is our most satisfactory remembrance that 
 throughout our year's work we have fought the good fight on the 
 side of those without voice or power to hire a voice. Financially, 
 our service to the Veterans at the Home have consisted in great 
 part of the constant dispensing of sums difficult to keep accurate 
 account of. In other ways we are pleased to think that we have 
 done more. We have tried in time of need to be near; in time of 
 disappointment and hope deferred to give assurance that friends 
 were faithful and that a better day might confidently be expected. 
 Being on the spot it has been our great pleasure to superintend 
 and to aid the Winston-Salem Children's Chapter to placing its gift 
 in the rooms it is renovating. Along these lines we hope to be 
 afforded greater opportunities of rendering services to other Chap- 
 ters.

 Each month since January, 1919, we have made monthly dona- 
 tions, either to the Confederate Veterans' Home, Woman's Home or 
 some needy Veteran in our immediate vicinity. Our donations have 
 consisted of: In May 20 lbs. of chewing tobacco sent Veterans' 
 Home; large box of magazines to Veterans' Home; June ISth we 
 gave an out-of-door pageant, entitled "The Opposite End of the 
 World," on Salem College Campus, with a cast of over 100 children. 
 In addition to the pageant we sold ice cream, home-made candy and 
 sweet peas. Our gross receipts amounted to $200.00, and our net 
 receipts $185.00. We invited all Veterans from Norfleet Camp to be 
 our guests, and quite a number came. In July we entertained 7 
 Veterans for lunch, took Veterans for auto drives, and took a very 
 poor Veteran, living 10 miles up the country, a "Sunshine Box" 
 containing 5 lbs. of sugar, 25-lb. sack of flour, can of lard, 1 sack 
 cornmeal, 2 packages of coffee, several lbs. fat back, 4 cans of syrup, 
 and some chewing tobacco. The "Sunshine Box" contains just the 
 articles most needed by the individual — groceries, clothing, etc. In 
 August we took another box to a very needy Veteran, containing a

 hat, shirt, woolen and lightweight socks, underclothing, necktie, felt 
 bed-room slippers, handkerchiefs, woolen gloves, and also clothing to 
 his wife, besides groceries of various kinds and bed clothing. We 
 sent a box of magazines to Woman's Home, and are renovating the 
 two large sitting rooms at Veterans' Home at Raleigh. We have 
 had the walls, ceilings and floors painted, tables varnished, electric 
 lights installed, and sent linoleum for floors; also 7 lovely sofa 
 cushions, 2 table runners, and during the fall expect to raise money 
 to send easy chairs and other needed articles. Our entire Chapter 
 has donated a comfort robe to the Infirmary, and Co. B is now busy 
 making another one which we expect to send in a few weeks. Since 
 writing this report have added $6.25 to Treasury.

 REMARKS 
 
 The Jethro Brown Chapter, Boys' Division, Co. C, was organized 
 in June, 1919, by Mrs. A. C. Chamberlain. Twenty-six little boys 
 were charter members (blanks for all not in yet but will be soon). 
 They are very enthusiastic. (1) They fitted out one needy Veteran 
 in summer, outfit consisting of one suit of clothes, 4 top shirts, 4 
 suits underwear, 6 pair socks, 2 pair shoes, 1 hat. (2) One more 
 needy Veteran fitted out for winter: 1 nice wool suit of clothes, 1 
 top shirt, 1 pair suspenders, underwear (wool), 4 pair wool socks, 
 2 ties, 1 hat. (3) Two Veterans remembered at birthday: cigars 
 to one and bunch of flowers to another, tied with national colors. 
 (4) Three months' subscription to morning paper given to one old 
 Veteran who loves to read. (5) Boys sell cookies at school to help 
 swell Treasury. We are going to keep up one bed in the Infirmary 
 of Soldiers' Home. The boys visit the soldiers, offering their services 
 to them if needed. We meet once a month at homes of the boys.

 The invocation included a special prayer fdr Mrs. Burkheimer, 
 who has been true and loyal to the cause of the Confederacy. 
 
 An appropriate Scripture Reading was taken from the 7th Chap- 
 ter of Revelation, beginning with the 9th verse. After a beautiful 
 Anthem rendered by the Tar Heel Chapter of High Point, which 
 added much to the impressiveness of the hour, Mrs. Fannie Ransom 
 Williams read a Memoriam to Mrs. Leo D. Heartt. 
 
 Mrs. London, also a life-long friend of the latter, paid a short 
 tribute. 
 
 Before Roll Call of Daughters by Miss Helen Brockett, comforting 
 words were spoken by the Chaplain, quoting from Maxwell Burt, 
 "There is no death nor change nor any ending, only a journey and 
 so many go, that we who stay at length discern the blending of the 
 two roads, two breaths, two lives, and so come to the high and 
 quiet knowledge that the dead are but ourselves made beautiful 
 instead." 
 
 The following tribute to "Sons of the Confederacy," who made the 
 supreme sacrifice in this great war, was given by Mrs. Witherington. 
 
 The human race through ages, burnt the incense of admiration 
 and reverence at the shrine of patriotism and self devotion. "Oh! 
 glorious is he" (exclaims Homer, the Trojan warrior) "who for 
 his country falls." 
 
 To-day our memories are peopled with a multitude of heroes, 
 stricken in the flower of youth, who but recently went forth to 
 battle for a just and righteous cause, to make the world safe for 
 democracy. Hereafter the French will have to share Verdun with 
 us as a place of pilgrimage. The immortal challenge of the French 
 was "They shall not pass" when they held the gateway of that 
 city in 1916. "We shall pass" was the American watchword, and 
 in less than six weeks they had cleared the roads from Verdun to 
 Sedan. 
 
 Oh! tell me not they are dead, that generous host, that army of 
 invincible heroes. They hover as a cloud of witnesses above the 
 nation. Indeed it is an honor to us to honor them, especially those 
 of our own who fell afar; those for whom we placed the golden 
 star: Sons of the Confederacy, manifesting the same brave spirit 
 as their heroic ancestors who, considering the tremendous obsta- 
 cles they had to face, made such a record of bravery and endur- 
 ance that their names should and will be remembered and honored 
 from generation to generation. Our recent heroes, unlike their 
 noble ancestors, went forth to battle with the sunset of victory 
 before them, assured of ultimate success. 
 
 Quoting from "Memories of the Confederacy," compiled by Mrs. 
 Andrew Howell, a former Historian of the Cape Fear Chapter, and

 written in 1917 just prior to our entrance into the war, she made 
 this statement: that if God wills the worst comes to us, North 
 Carolina men will be found where the fighting is fiercest and the 
 risks deadliest. Was her statement not verified when they broke 
 the Hindenburg Line? 
 
 The London Times says the part the Amercican Expeditionary 
 Forces took in breaking the defenses of the Hindenburg Line and 
 the Canal Tunnel, forcing a crossing of the canal, were achieve- 
 ments worthy of the most experienced soldiers of the Allied armies. 
 
 The London Times further says: these men were Southerners, 
 chiefly Carolinians, men of Tennessee and New Yorkers, who held 
 an important position on the left, while the others broke through 
 the line. 
 
 It was the Southerners who took the village of Bellecourt and 
 Manray. Both officers and men did all that was humanly possible 
 for brave men to do. 
 
 Indeed we are saddened that these young lives, so full of joy 
 and hope, were cut short. But after all, is not life measured by 
 the usefulness accomplished, and not the length? They made the 
 supreme sacrifice for the mighty needs of earth, for needs of the 
 ages coming to birth. 
 
 And until the mountains are worn out, the rivers forget to flow, 
 till the clouds grow weary of replenishing the earth, shall we forget 
 to revere and honor their names which are inscribed upon the 
 National Book of remembrance. 
 
 Let us say with Edwin Markham: 
 
 "Glory to the Lord; the Hero of Heaven, 
 Glory! that He gathers the heroes home 
 Out of the red fields, out of the foam; 
 
 Gathers them out of the everywhere 
 
 Into the Camp, that is 'over there.' " 
 
 After calling the roll of over 200 heroic sons of the Confederacy 
 who made the supreme sacrifice in the great world war, Mrs. With- 
 erington stated the Memorial Hour could not close without calling 
 the name of one who had added double laurels to the heroes crown 
 — Lieut. Don Kirkman. After gallantly defending his country and 
 under the providence of God returned to his native State in the 
 flower of manhood, with the world beckoning him on in the full- 
 ness of its glory, he again sees the opportunity to offer his life for 
 the rescue of another, and with a soul true to himself, to woman- 
 hood and to God, he makes the supreme sacrifice for the lovely 
 daughter of our own family. 
 
 Truly "Greater love hath no man, than this, that a man lay down 
 his life for his friend." 
 
 With a soulful rendition of Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar," by 
 Mrs. John Peacock, and a moment of prayer, the Memorial Hour 
 closed.

 MEMORIAL TO MRS. LEO. D. HEARTT 
 
 God's finger touched her and she slept. On the 13th of July, 
 1919, the Heavenly Father felt the need of another full-blown flower 
 within his garden of Everlasting life, and so His finger gently 
 touched the forehead of our beloved friend, and as a tired child 
 in its mother's arms, Mrs. Leo D. Heartt fell gently to sleep, to 
 be awakened by the paeons of angels in the home of her Savior 
 on High, there to find waiting and watching the beloved husband 
 who had preceded her but a few short years. 
 
 Ann Maria Dewey, known to and beloved by the North Carolina 
 Division, U. D. C, as Mrs. Leo D. Heartt, was born in New Bern, 
 N. C, on May 21, 1850, having therefore lived to the good age of 
 69 years. 
 
 She was the daughter of Capt. Oliver S. and Matilda Sparrow 
 Dewey, and was reared in a home noted for its intelligence and 
 luxury, her father being a graduate of Yale and devoted to read- 
 ing and study; her mother the possessor of wealth and culture, 
 and one who gave her life to looking after the needs of the many 
 colored who needed her continued attention on a plantation. Capt. 
 Oliver Dewey, though a Connecticut man of birth, was an ardent 
 advocate of secession, and while too old to enter active service 
 held the position of Post Quartermaster at Kinston all during the 
 war. His eldest son left college at Yale and volunteered as a pri- 
 vate in the Confederate array, rising to the rank of Captain of 
 Co. H, First North Carolina Cavalry. 
 
 Thus it was that the subject of this memoriam had instilled into 
 her the truest traits of the Southern Confederacy, and she imbibed 
 them with an ardor that continued through life. She saw and fully 
 realized all the sorrows and sufferings of the South during the 
 war and the even worse days of Reconstruction. She saw wealth 
 and luxury vanish and learned what the Southern people really 
 suffered. 
 
 At the age of fourteen she entered Salem Academy and remained 
 there until the war closed. 
 
 On February 14, 1871, she pledged her young heart and hand in 
 marriage to Mr. Leo D. Heartt, a marriage that brought her many 
 joys, and which was severed by death only a short while ago, leav- 
 ing her with one son and three daughters. 
 
 Soon after going with her young husband to his home in Raleigh, 
 Mrs. Heartt joined the Southern Memorial Association there and 
 soon became its president, which position she held until her hus- 
 band moved to Durham. It was during this period that she took 
 the warmest interest in aiding in the removal of the Confederate 
 dead from Arlington to Raleigh

 Moving to Durham Mrs. Heartt took an active part in every 
 good work. She was a charter member and officer of the first 
 literary club of that place, and soon became President of the 
 Julian S. Carr Chapter, U. D. C. She remained at the head of this 
 Chapter until her return to make Raleigh her home. 
 
 Recognizing her loyalty as a Daughter the Johnston-Pettigrew 
 Chapter of Raleigh chose her as their president, and truly and 
 faithfully did she serve them until ill health compelled her to 
 retire. 
 
 The North Carolina Division later chose her as their Honorary 
 Vice-President, and this office she held when she left us. Mrs. 
 Heartt's last appearance anywhere in public was at the U. D. C. 
 Convention in Raleigh, for on the last afternoon of that meeting she 
 was taken ill, and from then on her health gradually failed; but 
 through all her illness she never lost interest in the Daughters of the 
 Confederacy, and lived to see her dearly beloved daughter placed at 
 the head of the North Carolina Division. 
 
 Mrs. Heartt was the very embodiment of all that is sweet and 
 lovely in woman. Quiet, gentle, unassuming, she was a woman 
 who drew the hearts of those who knew her to her and knit them 
 in bonds of everlasting friendship. Quiet and gentle as she was, 
 she stood staunchly and unflinchingly for the right, and no argu- 
 ment could swerve her towards anything unjust or wrong. 
 
 Her life was a gentle benediction to all who loved her, and she 
 leaves us a memory fraught with good deeds, a memory in which 
 gentleness, nobility, Christianity breathe ever her name, but above 
 all has she left to the North Carolina Division a most precious 
 heritage in the three lovely women who call her mother, and whom 
 we so gladly number among our Daughters. 
 
 She is passing by on the other side, and we know is again happy 
 with her loved ones, but yet time and again we pause and listen 
 and watch as — 
 
 "We sigh for the touch of a vanished hand, 
 And a sound of the voice that is still." 
 
 Fannie Ransom Williams.

 PRESIDENT'S REPORT 
 To the North Carolina Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy,

 endeavor, made possible only by your loyal co-operation and support.

 But the feeling of pride which you justly have in your achievements 
 is tinged with sorrow in the loss of the "Mother of our Division," Mrs. 
 W. M. Parsley, who passed away on the 11th day of June, 1920. Largely 
 through her efforts the North Carolina Division was founded ; she was 
 its first President and for many years her genius guided it. Notice of 
 her death was received too late to attend her funeral at Wilmington 
 but a beautiful floral tribute and messages of sympathy were sent in the 
 name of the Division. 
 
 It will give you pleasure to welcome into the Division, the R. H. Ricks 
 Chapter, of Nashville, the Greene County Chapter, of Snow Hill, the 
 Fort Macon Chapter of Beaufort, the Neuse Chapter, of Oriental, the 
 Colonel Nethercutt Chapter, of Maysville, the Captain James Warner 
 Cooper Chapter, of Murphy, the Edward F. White Chapter, of Vance- 
 boro, Aulander Chapter, Aulander, all organized during the past year 
 through the interested efforts of District Directors, five of them by 
 Mrs. Annie E. Hughes, Director of District No. 14. It was my pleasure 
 to be present at the organization of three of these Chapters, the J. B. 
 Singletary Chapter, of Greenville, the Joseph B. Cherry Chapter, of 
 Merry Hill, and the Highland Boys Chapter, of Saint Paul, which have 
 been inactive for several years have been revived, and one, the Major 
 T. J. Wooten Chapter, of Maxton is reported dead. 
 
 At our last Annual Convention a recommendation was adopted that 
 two prizes of ten dollars each be offered, one to the Chapter showing 
 the greatest numerical increase, the other to the Chapter showing the 
 greatest percentage of increase, in membership, and that a drive for 
 increased membership be put on in the Division. The result has been 
 most gratifying. Seven hundred and ninety-three certificates of mem- 
 bership having been issued. 
 
 One hundred Crosses of Honor have been bestowed this year, seventy- 
 six on Veterans and twenty-four on descendants of Veterans. 
 
 The District Directors have much responsibility and it is to them 
 that I have looked this year for much of the work accomplished by 
 the Division, in seeing that the Chapters in their District are actively 
 at work and their interest at all times stimulated. It is with pride that 
 I am able to report that each District in the Division, of which there 
 are sixteen, has an interested and enthusiastic Director and that all but 
 one held its annual District Meeting. It was my privilege to attend 
 ten of these meetings and, in each instance, I was gratified by the 
 work accomplished and the interest manifested. An attempt was made 
 to hold a confereence with the District Directors, but for various 
 reasons many were unable to attend and the results hoped for were 
 not obtained. However I have kept in close touch with them through 
 monthly letters. 
 
 This year for the first time a banner is offered by Mrs. T. G. 
 Hyman, in memory of her father, Mr. William B. Lane, a courageous

 and fearless Confederate soldier who served throughout the four years 
 of the war, to the District making the best annual report, and will be 
 awarded at this Convention. 
 
 Wednesday evening of each Convention has been set aside as 
 Children's Evening, making it a distinctive feature of the Convention. 
 The Children's Work is in the hands of an efficient Director, who has 
 organized five new Chapters and has enrolled 363 new members during 
 the year. An innovation in the life of the Division was the invitation 
 extended District No. 5 by the Children's Chapter of Thomasville to be 
 their guest on President Davis' birthday. A luncheon was served by 
 the children and their exercises were a feature of the meeting which 
 was presided over by their leader. District No. 7 has been invited by 
 the Frank Bennett Chapter, C. of C, to be their guest next year. 
 
 Our Chairman of Education will make a report showing the progress 
 of this work in the Division this year. We had already contributed 
 liberally to the Endowment, or Hero, Fund, but, at Tampa, the General 
 Convention undertook to complete the fund of $50,000 and each 
 Division, including our own, pledged $100. At the same time $50 was 
 pledged to the Confederate Woman's Relief Work. 
 
 One of the chief phases of the work of the Division this year has 
 been that of compiling records of the boys of Confederate lineage who 
 served in the World War, as the world will look to our organization 
 for this information. The Division also pledged its assistance to the 
 North Carolina Historical Commission in collecting the records of all 
 who served in the World War from our State. Your Director of War 
 Records, Mrs. R. P. Holt, has been encouraged by the beginning which 
 has been made, having received from the Division 1,066 records, and 
 it is earnestly hoped that the coming year will show marked progress 
 in this undertaking. 
 
 Two most worthy appeals have been presented to you this year, one 
 by Mrs. E. F. Reid, Chairman of the Committee Looking Forward to 
 Establishing a Free Bed for a tubercular patient at Sanitorium, N. C, 
 the • other by Mrs. M. O. Winstead, Chairman of the Committee on 
 the Rebecca Winbourne Marker. For the former the necessary funds 
 have been raised and a full report will be made to 3^ou. It is hoped 
 that in a very short time sufficient money will be available for the 
 latter. 
 
 Especially to be commended are the year books which have been sent 
 your Division President, by Gastonia, Bethel Heroes, High Point, and 
 Guilford Chapters. These contain most interesting programs of meet- 
 ings and entertainments for the year, the one published by the Gastonia 
 Chapter being unusually complete and instructive. The example of 
 these Chapters is worthy of your consideration. 
 
 At our last Convention a resolution was passed endorsing the League 
 of Nations and copies forwarded to President Wilson, Senators Simmons

 and Overman, and Hon. W. H. Taft, President of the League to 
 Enforce Peace, of which courteous acknowledgment was made. 
 
 The Division authorized General Metts, Commander of the North 
 Carolina Division of Confederate Veterans, to arrange with some one 
 to put in order the grounds around the North Carolina monument at 
 Appomattox. A letter has been reecived from General Metts, stating 
 that this work has been done and the road leading to the main road 
 repaired, making it possible for automobiles to pass around the monu- 
 ment and also wide enough for the monument to be seen from the road, 
 all at a cost of $65, but that a loyal friend had agreed to donate this 
 amount, thus relieving the Division of this expense. 
 
 A year ago a motion was introduced by Mrs. H. A. London that the 
 Division appoint a Committee to find out what churches ofifered their 
 bells to the Confederate Government to be cast into cannon. A like 
 motion was later introduced at the General Convention and a Com- 
 mittee appointed by the President General, of which your Division 
 President is Chairman, to collect this interesting and valuable bit of 
 history. The suggestion that this information be obtained was originally 
 made by the late Major H. A. London. 
 
 The attention of your President was recently called to many unjust 
 and inaccurate statements in Muzzey's History of America now being 
 taught in our public schools and a criticism made to the State Superin- 
 tendent of Public Instruction by me and a number of others who read 
 it. The State Text Book Commission, of which he is Chairman, 
 refused to adopt this history until s'atisfactory revision was made. Later 
 the publishers forwarded me a copy of the revised edition but the 
 objectionable features, in my judgment, have not all been eliminated and 
 it is hoped that still further modification will be required before it is 
 adopted for general use in our schools. The entire matter has been 
 referred to the Committee on Southern Literature and Endorsement of 
 Books of the General Division. 
 
 "Lightly, sweetly, soft and low 
 Come the songs of long ago, 
 Songs our mothers loved and sung. 
 In the days when we were young; 
 Songs we never can forget, 
 Songs our hearts are singing yet." 
 
 A resolution was passed at the last Convention authorizing the 
 President to appoint a Musical Director for the Division in order that 
 our Southern melodies and songs might become more familiar to the 
 members of the Division. Mrs. Edgar Cheek of Durham was appointed 
 and has accepted. 
 
 It may interest you to know that there are 160 subscribers in this 
 Division to The Confederate Veteran. I bespeak for it your loyal

 support. Its pages are always interesting, containing a monthly letter 
 to you from your President General as well as monthly programs 
 arranged for the Chapters by the Historian General. A prize of $50 
 has been offered to the Division obtaining the largest number of new 
 subscribers, and it will give you pleasure to know that through the 
 efforts of one of the Division's most loyal Daughters, Mrs. R. P. Holt, 
 this prize has been won by North Carolina. 
 
 During my term of office earnest appeals have been made in behalf 
 of the Confederate Woman's Home, and the response has been most 
 gratifying. The Chapters have contributed money and supplies which 
 have aided materially in its support and without which much of its 
 benevolent work would have ceased. The nurse you have placed in the 
 Home has proven a great blessing to those in need of her services. 
 On June 2nd a conference was held at Faj^etteville between the Directors 
 and the Advisory Board of the Home at which it was decided to make 
 an appeal to the Legislature about to convene for an emergency appro- 
 priation of $5,000 for maintenance for 1920 and of $2,500 for permanent 
 improvements. In August the Directors, the Advisory Board, and the 
 Committee on Appropriations and Pensions for the North Carolina 
 Division U. D. C, met in Raleigh to lay this request before the Legis- 
 lature but at a conference between Governor Bickett, the Council of. 
 State and the Directors of the Home, a way was devised to secure the 
 appropriation. This will enable the Home to meet its obligations and 
 continue its benevolent work. In order that the scope of its influence 
 may be enlarged, it is hoped and desired that the Chapters will not 
 cease their activities in its behalf, remembering at all times those 
 women who need their comforting care. 
 
 A request was made at our last Convention that never a year should 
 pass without some Chapter inviting the Veterans for their annual 
 reunion and this request was most deeply appreciated by General Metts. 
 Let us realize how short a time we have to impress upon them the 
 veneration, love and affection in which we hold them. May we not 
 forget that the highest tribute we can pay to our heroic dead is a proper 
 care for the living. 
 
 On June 1st the North Carolina Division of Confederate Veterans 
 were the guests of the City of Fayetteville, and the J. E. B. Stuart 
 Chapter assisted in their entertainment, ministering at all times to their 
 comfort. As your Division President I was invited to attend their 
 reunion and extend to the Veterans greetings from the Division. The 
 Division was honored by the appointment of Mrs. Marshall Williams, 
 one of its former Presidents, as sponsor. Several other former Presi- 
 dents attended as did many of the Daughters. 
 
 One of the many impressive features of this reunion was the day 
 spent by the Veterans at Camp Bragg where they were the guests of 
 General McNair, Commandant of Camp Bragg, and his staff. Out of

 respect to the Veterans the mess hall was decorated with Confederate 
 flags, and the reception accorded them by the Camp was most cordial. 
 
 At this reunion the presence of Colonel Robert H. Ricks, who during 
 the year has passed to the Great Beyond, was greatly missed. It was 
 my privilege to atend his funeral and pay the Division's tribute cf 
 respect to his memory, for he was always a loyal and devoted friend 
 to the Daughters of the Confederacy. 
 
 During the year as President of your Division, I have been honored 
 with many invitations, some of which I was unable to accept. One of 
 the most pleasant occasions was the annual meeting of our sister 
 organization, The Daughters of the American Revolution, held in 
 Salisbury last November, at which time I brought greetings from this 
 Division. 
 
 In August, while in Asheville, I was the guest of the Asheville and 
 Fannie Patton Chapters at a dinner given by these Chapters at the 
 United States Training Camp for Women. During the same visit I 
 was privileged to attend a joint meeting of the Fannie Patton Chapter 
 and the local Camp of Veterans at which time, by request, I assisted 
 the President of the Chapter in the presentation of Crosses. 
 
 To commemorate the brilliant victory of General Hoke at South 
 West Creek, near Kinston, in 1865, a marker was unveiled on the 
 battlefield on May 10th, by the North Carolina Historical Commission 
 and the A. M. Waddell Chapter, U. D. C, and I was requested to rep- 
 resent this Division. 
 
 On January 19th I was invited to address the Julian S. Carr Chapter, 
 the Veterans of R. F. Webb Camp and other invited guests who had 
 met to fittingly commemorate the anniversary of the births of Generals 
 iLee and Jackson. 
 
 The preceding day (Sunday), at memorial exercises held in the 
 Episcopal Church at Kinston by the A. M. Waddell Chapter, the rector 
 requested your President to bring forward, in the name of the Division, 
 the Confederate Flag which was laid upon the altar and a special 
 prayer offered. 
 
 An invitation has been received from the University of North Carolina 
 to attend the exercises of University Day at Chapel Hill on the 12th 
 instant, at which time a rare portrait of General Davis will be presented 
 to the University. Being with you today and therefore unable to 
 attend I have appointed Mrs. Alfred Williams, a daughter of General 
 J. Bryan Grimes, to represent the Division. 
 
 By reason of a previous engagement I was unable to attend the annual 
 meeting of the State Federation of Woman's Clubs to which I was 
 invited, but at my request the Division was represented by Mrs. Hayden, 
 your first Vice-President. 
 
 It has been a real pleasure to me to atend meetings of Green County, 
 Fort Macon, New Bern, George B. Singletary, and McDowell Chapters,

22 Minutes of the Twenty-fourth Annual Convention 
 
 at which I spoke on the aims and purposes of our work. Following the 
 meeting of the McDowell Chapter, a charming reception was given at 
 the home of Mrs. Hudgins. 
 
 On September 16th, the North Carolina Historical Commission, The 
 North Carolina Division, United Confederate Veterans, and the North 
 Carolina Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy, in the presence 
 of a large and distinguished gathering, dedicated a memorial to General 
 Stephen Dodson Ramseur, at Belle Grove Farm, twelve miles south of 
 Winchester, Virginia, near the spot where General Ramseur died. The 
 following day a similar marker erected to the memory of General 
 Joseph Johnston Pettigrew, on the LeFevre Farm at Bunker Hill, West 
 Virginia, twelve miles north of Winchester, near the home in which 
 General Pettigrew died, was unveiled. Your President, by invitation, 
 presided over the exercises of the first day, and Mrs. Jacksie Daniel 
 Thrash, Chairman of the Committee appointed by this Division to 
 superintend the erection of these markers, responded to the address of 
 welcome on the second day. These markers are handsome in design 
 and you may be justly proud of them. A full report will be made you 
 by Mrs. Thrash. 
 
 A meeting of the Executive Board of the Division, the Fannie Patton 
 Chapter and the Asheville Chapter, was held at Battery Park Hotel, at 
 Asheville, on April 6th, for the purpose of outlining a program for the 
 General Convention and raising such funds as should be contributed by 
 the Division for its entertainment. The Chapters were heartily inter- 
 ested in the Convention and credit is due them for the complete and 
 well planned ararngements. Members of the Board were guests of 
 honor at a dinner given by District No. 1 in the ball room at Battery 
 Park, which was also attended by representatives of all the civic organ- 
 izations of the City of Asheville who pledged their support and co- 
 operation in the entertainment of the General Convention. 
 
 The Kiwanis Club of the city asked the Executive Board to endorse 
 a movement inaugurated by the club urging the Legislature to give 
 immediate atention to the enactment of legislation providing for a sub- 
 stantial increase in the salaries of school teachers and to maintain a 
 higher standard of education. The movement was heartily endorsed 
 and a committee appointed to attend the Citizens Conference of Educa- 
 tion held in Greensboro in July. 
 
 North Carolina has reason to be proud of the honors that came to it 
 at the General Convention at Tampa. Two of our most loyal and efl&- 
 cient Daughters were elected to office, Mrs. R. P. Holt as Third Vice- 
 President and Mrs. Fannie Ransom Williams as Registrar General. 
 For the third time the Raines Banner for the best essay on Confederate 
 History was awarded our Division and received by Miss Shuford, our 
 Division Historian. The R. H. Ricks Banner, presented to the Chil- 
 dren's Chapter doing the best work in the General Division, was won

 by the Jethro Brown Children's Chapter of Wniston-Salem, this 
 being the third time this banner has been won by a Children's Chapter 
 of the North Carolina Division. The Alexander Farris Loving Cup, 
 given by our beloved President General, Mrs. Roy McKinney, in memory 
 of her father, and awarded to the Division making the greatest gain m 
 membership between the ages of 18 and 25 since April, 1919, was also 
 won by North Carolina. You are to be congratulated on such a record. 
 
 A year ago at High Point a resolution was passed instructing the 
 delegates of this Division at Tampa to extend to the United Division an 
 invitation to hold its 1920 Convention in Asheville provided they deemed 
 it wise to do so after reaching Tampa. The matter was fully discussed 
 by them and it was unanimously decided to extend the invitation. When 
 it was done, the other Divisions, who had expected to ask for the Con- 
 vention, decided not to do so and Ashevile was enthusiastically chosen. 
 Every indication points to a memorable and enjoyable Convention, and 
 it is hoped that, as our Division is hostess, each Chapter will be well 
 represented. The plans for its entertainment are well matured and the 
 coming of the United Division to our State will be a source of great 
 inspiration to us in our work. 
 
 Eighteen months ago you bestowed upon me the greatest honor and 
 responsibility which was yours to give. The faith which you placed in 
 me has made me endeavor to meet its duties and responsibilities. I was 
 fearful at the time that I did not have sufficient strength to serve you, 
 but your confidence and support, together with the helpfulness and 
 co-operation of those who shared the labor and responsibility with me, 
 and to whom I wish to express my deepest appreciation, has at all times 
 strengthened me. The service to which you called me has required 
 singleness of purpose, devotion and often disregard of personal pursuit, 
 but you have made me realize that the reward of work faithfully done 
 is the opportunity to do greater work, and I hope in the coming years 
 to serve my successors and the North Carolina Division with the best 
 that is within me. 
 
 We have faithfully cared for those who fought under the Stars and 
 Bars and those dependent on them. We have assisted in writing a true 
 history of the War Between the States. We have proclaimed the 
 immortal deeds of Southern valor in song and story and preserved them 
 in bronze and stone. Let us now look with renewed zeal to the new day 
 that is dawning — a day to be glorified by our educational work which 
 shall beget in our children a just pride in the valor and heroism of the 
 Confederate Soldier and an appreciation of their noble heritage. 
 
 "A King once said of a Prince struck down 
 Taller he seems in death, 
 And this speech holds true for then as now, 
 'Tis after death we measure men.

 And as mists of the past are rolled away 
 Our heroes who died in the tattered gray 
 Grow taller and greater in all their parts 
 Till they fill our minds as they fill our hearts, 
 Yes, they grow taller as the years go by 
 And the world learns how they could do and die." 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. C. F. Harvey, 
 President N. C. Div., U. D. C. 
 
 Mrs. J. D. Thrash moved that this splendid report be accepted 
 by a rising vote of thanks. Carried. 
 
 The Recording Secretary read her report. 
 
 RECORDING SECRETARY'S REPORT. 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 It is with the greatest pleasure, as your Recording Secretary, I bring 
 to you a report of the increased activities of our Division. 
 
 Eight new U. D. C. Chapters have been registered and three reor- 
 ganized. 
 
 The new chapters are as follows : 
 
 The Robert H. Ricks Chapter, Nashville. 
 
 The Green County Chapter, Snow Hill. 
 
 C. I. Nethercutt Chapter, Maysville. 
 
 Neuse Chapter, Oriental. 
 
 Fort Macon Chapter, Beaufort. 
 
 Capt. James Warner Cooper Chapter, Murphy. 
 
 Edward F. White Chapter, Vanceboro. 
 
 Aulander Chapter, Aulander. 
 
 The reorganized chapters are : 
 
 Geo. B. Singletary Chapter, Greenville. 
 
 Highland Boys Chapter, St. Pauls. 
 
 Joseph B. Cherry Chapter, Merry Hill. 
 
 Four new Children's Chapters have also been registered as follows : 
 
 The Spring Hope Juniors, Spring Hope. 
 
 Martha Keplar Chapter, Asheville. 
 
 Francis Fox Chapter, Pollocksville. 
 
 Zeb Vance Juniors (boys), Gastonia. 
 
 This unusually large increase in the Division is due chiefly to the 
 untiring eiTorts of our State President, who has attended almost every 
 District meeting and has left no stone unturned to further our beloved 
 organization. 
 
 It has been one of the greatest pleasures of my office to have been 
 associated with her and to know intimately of her wonderful work for 
 the Division.

 I have written several hundred letters and cards, and mailed many 
 packages, besides sending out notices for my use with "promptness" for 
 my motto. Until January I sent out 1,000 application blanks. Since 
 then they have been in the hands of the State Registrar. 
 
 With the Conevntion call I sent a post card to each Chapter asking 
 if they had received the call. 
 
 Through the medium of the mails I have made delightful friends 
 among our "Daughters" all over the State and feel that my office, 
 while strenuous, has been worth while to me. 
 
 Since the spring I have sent extra copies of the High Point Minutes 
 to the Chairmen of the State Committees and District Directors, to the 
 new Chapters and to the Historical Commission. 
 
 Our State President had copies of these minutes bound in gray 
 leather and sent to the Hall of History in Raleigh and the Confederate 
 Museum in Richmond. 
 
 I signed and sealed 200 Children's Certificates and sent to the Division 
 Director. 
 
 I have had the pleasure of visiting several Chapters in my District, 
 when I made talks on U. D. C. work and also reorganized the Chapter at 
 St. Pauls. 
 
 Whenever possible I have sent a line to ofJer any assistance I could 
 give and welcomed each new Chapter into the Division. 
 
 On April 6th, at the call of my President, I attended a meeting of the 
 Executive Committee with the local Chapters at Asheville. The mem- 
 bers of our official family who were present at this meeting felt repaid 
 for our long trip by the courteous hospitality extended us by the Ashe- 
 ville Daughters. 
 
 I would recommend that hereafter each Recording Secretary of this 
 Division keep a file of the Printed Minutes and pass them on to her 
 successor so that she may be in a position to furnish information as to 
 the past of the Division. 
 
 It is wonderful what a bond this U. D. C. is, and we know wherever 
 there is a Chapter of the U. D. C. there is reverence and honor for our 
 men of the "sixties." Dear Daughters, let us hold fast to our heritage. 
 
 It was my privilege to register each of the 600 Veterans who attended 
 our State Reunion in Fayetteville in June, and my heart was full of 
 tenderness and pride as I listened to many stories from these heroes. 
 
 I feel that my office in the Division is a tribute to my father, who 
 carried the last message at Appomattox. 
 
 The proudest heritagr I can boast is that I am the daughter of a Con- 
 federate soldier, who wore the gray and followed Lee to Appomattox. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 (Mrs. John H.) Lucy London Anderson, 
 
 Recording Secretary.

 Mrs. Thrash moved that in accordance with the Secretary's 
 recommendation, a full set of the annual reports be obtained

 very kindly donated hers to the Division to be kept by the 
 Recording Secretary, 
 
 Mrs. Josephus Daniels moved that the gift of Mrs. Williams

United Daughters of the Confederacy 33 
 
 Mrs. J. F. Taylor, the Corresponding Secretary, read her 
 report, which was accepted. 
 
 CORRESPONDING SECRETARY'S REPORT 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 In coming to you again with a report, I wish to express my great 
 pleasure and sincere appreciation of the privilege of having some small 
 part in a work so noble and so glorious as that of the United Daughters 
 of the Confederacy, and to thank you for your prompt and hearty 
 response at all times. 
 
 Since October, 1919, I have written four hundred and forty-eight 
 (448) letters; one hundred and thirty-two (132) post cards and five (5) 
 telegrams. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. J. L. Taylor, 
 Corresponding Secretary, North Carolina Division, U. D. C. 
 
 Mrs. L. E. Fisher, Registrar, read the following- report: 
 
 REGISTRAR'S REPORT 
 
 Madame President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 No Registrar ever came to Convention happier than I. All records in 
 registrations have been broken by this year's work. Eight hundred and 
 twenty-eight registries have been recorded this year, which is more 
 than twice as many as have been recorded during any previous year. 
 Of these eight hundred and twenty-eight registries, seven hundred and 
 seventy-seven were new members added to the Division by application, 
 sixteen were by demit from other States and six were by reinstatement, 
 giving a total of seven hundred and ninety-nine additions to the Division 
 this year, making a grand total of 5,895 members in the North Carolina 
 Division today as reported by Chapters supplemented by records of last 
 year. Seventy-four Chapters have responded with revised rolls of mem- 
 bership this year against fifty-seven last year. Twenty-nine registries 
 were transfers of members from one Chapter to another within the 
 Division. Eighteen certificates have been secured for old members who 
 had never received their certificates. 
 
 Eight new Chapters have been organized during the year, there being 
 Robert H. Ricks at Nashville, Green County at Snow Hill, Colonel 
 Nethercutt at Maysville, Neuse at Oriental, Fort Macon at Beaufort, 
 Captain James Warner Cooper at Murphy, Edward F. White at Vance- 
 boro, and Aulander at Aulander. 
 
 Three thousand eight hundred seventy-five application blanks have 
 been sent out to the Chapters of the State since February 16, when 
 the President-General authorized it to be my duty to handle the blanks 
 for the Division.

 tion of this fine report. 
 
 Carried. 
 
 The President asked Mrs. Marshall Williams to come to the 
 rostrum. 
 
 In eloquent words Mrs. Williams presented the prizes offered 
 by the State President, Mrs. C. F. Harvey, for the largest 
 increase in membership and the largest percentage increase. 
 Th Asheville Chapter, Ashville, won the prize of $10.00 in

 greatest increase in members of any Chapter in the Thirteenth 
 District. 
 
 Mrs. M. O. Winstead moved that the banner be brought for- 
 ward so all the delegates might see it. 
 
 Motion carried. 
 
 Miss Carter brought forward the banner of the Nashville 
 Chapter, which is to be carried to the General Convention at 
 Asheville. It was received with enthusiasm. 
 
 Mrs. S. N. Harrell read her report as Recorder of Crosses. 
 
 REPORT OF RECORDER OF CROSSES 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 It gives me much pleasure to give the following report as your 
 Recorder of Crosses. The work I have done as same has given me 
 real joy. I have undertaken each time an application or a call for 
 blanks came in to give the matter my immediate attention, answering 
 all letters by return mail when possible. I regret that we were badly 
 hampered for the first six months I was in office by being unable to 
 get the necessary papers from Mrs. Mason,, our Custodian. As soon 
 as they came to me I sent them promptly to those who were waiting 
 for them. I am very pleased to report a great increase in the number 
 of Crosses bestowed. From October 1919 to October 1920 I sent in

 orders for one hundred Crosses of Honor, seventeen were for descend- 
 ants or widows, ten were duplicated and seventy-three to be bestowed 
 anew upon our Veterans. I have written one hundred and sixty letters 
 and really enjoyed the work and splendid co-operation of all the 
 Chapter officers with whom it was my privilege to deal.

 Mrs. H. A. London moved that the Convention stand in 
 reverent silence for a moment as a tribute to the portraits of 
 Generals Lee and Jackson, which adorned the hall. This 
 motion was unanimously carried by the Daughters. 
 
 As Mrs. Josephus Daniels was obliged to leave she was given 
 special privilege of the floor. She spoke feelingly of her recent 
 visit to Gettysburg and that the line was unmarked where the 
 Twenty-sixth North Carolina Regiment made the farthest 
 charge. As the record of the Twenty-sixth North Carolina

 Regiment at Gettysburg is one of the most remarkable in his- 
 tory she suggested that this spot be marked by our Division. 
 So far the Sixth Montana Regiment shows the greatest loss at 
 Gettysburg. Mrs. Daniels plead with the Daughters to proceed 
 at once toward placing an appropriate marker there before all 
 Confederate Soldiers who fought at Gettysburg had passed 
 beyond. 
 
 Mrs. I. W. Faison, Mrs. J. A. Fore, Mrs. H. A. London, and 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams spoke feelingly on the subject. The 
 matter was deferred, to be discussed with other business on 
 Wednesday, October 14. 
 
 Miss Lowry Shuford read her report as Historian. 
 
 STATE HISTORIAN'S REPORT 
 
 At the close of this year I find a very marked improvement in the 
 Historical work. The number of reminiscences secured have been 
 gratifying, but I have been more pleased with the high standard of the 
 papers and the information contained in them. That the interest of 
 the young people is being awakened is shown in the fact that 112 essays, 
 mostly by high school pupils, have been written on Confederate subjects. 
 The donors of these prizes should feel that they have accomplished 
 much in that they have stimulated interest in the work among the 
 Daughters of the Confederacy. 
 
 The hope of last year was realized when Mr. Emanuel Rudisill, 
 of Sherman, Texas, sent to Col. Fred A. Olds at Hall of History, 
 the flag that was never surrendered, that of the 16th Regiment, North 
 Carolina State Troops. This flag was brought home by Mr. Rudisill, 
 the color bearer, concealed in the lining of his coat, and has been in 
 his possession until this year. 
 
 In January I mailed copies of State and General prizes to every 
 Chapter President in the Division, also copies of the regulations gov- 
 erning the prize on "Peace." Also sent copies of prizes to about 25 of 
 the leading papers of the State, asking them to publish same in their 
 columns. In August sent to every Chapter a blank report of Chapter 
 work. Besides this have written ninety-seven letters and twenty-four 
 post cards. My expenses to Division for the year has been $9.75. The 
 typewriting has been done, without expense to Division, by one of the 
 members of the Gastonia Chapter. 
 
 This year we had four contests. The number of entries was gratify- 
 ing, and the work excellent. They are as follows : 
 
 1. The Martha Glenn Loving Cup, offered by Mrs. S. A. Kindley of 
 Gastonia in memory of her mother, to Chapter making best historical 
 report.

 2. Ten dollar gold piece, offered by Mrs. Thos. W. Wilson of Gas- 
 tonia to Chapter sending in best Reminiscences of Woman of Confed- 
 eracy. 
 
 3. Ten dollar gold piece, offered by Miss Lowry Shuford of Gas- 
 tonia to Chapter sending in best Reminiscences of Confederate Vet- 
 eran. 
 
 4. The Henry A. London Medal, offered by Mrs. Henry A. London 
 of Pittsboro in memory of her husband, to any Daughter in this 
 Division who writes the best essay on "Causes That Led to War Between 
 the States." 
 
 I suggest that the newly elected State Historian publish a Year 
 Book, that each Chapter Historian have at least one lecture on some 
 Confederate subject made to High School pupils during the year, that 
 the Chapter Historian have published in local papers the list of General 
 and State prizes at least once during the year.

 My service to the State Division U. D. C. has been gladly given — 
 it vi^as not play, but a task of earnest endeavor to bind the Old South 
 to the new, in collecting Historical records from Daughters in our Old 
 North State from the mountains to the sea, striving for the sake cf 
 the glorious history we may preserve for future generations, and to 
 arouse new interest in the work before us. Our work is not complete, 
 it is just begun. 
 
 Daughters, don't neglect the reminiscences you may glean from the 
 few remaining heroes and heroines of the Sixties, as you know their 
 ranks are dwindling rapidly. 
 
 Let us arouse in the South the love that we, ourselves, may already 
 cherish, so when our work is finished it will live ever in the hearts 
 of those who come after. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 LowRY ShuFord, 
 Historian North Carolina Division, U. D. C. 
 
 The report was accepted with thanks and appreciation. 
 
 Moved and carried that thanks be sent to the young lady 
 who did the stenographic work for the State Historian. 
 
 The following was read by the Historian : 
 
 At a meeting of the State Board of Education in May the members 
 of the Board appropriated three and one-fourth million to further 
 the education of the youth of the State, of which we are proud, but we 
 deplore the fact that among the books passed by the Board was a 
 text book on American History, which I, with others, have read, and 
 find is not fair to the truths of Confederate History. The oflfending 
 book is "Muzzey's History of America," and has been taught in the 
 North Carolina schools. 
 
 Mr. B. R. Lacy, a member of the book commission, denounced the 
 book veliemently. Mr. Lacy says, "some of the statements that are 
 offensive to North Carolina parents, are the classification of Con- 
 federates as traitors ; the perpetuation of the old falsehood aobut Lee 
 surrendering sword to Grant, the denial of Sherman's atrocities in 
 the South, etc." 
 
 Superintendent E. C. Brooks has the promise that the objectionable 
 observations be deleted before the volume would be put in the North 
 Carolina Schools. 
 
 One of the Daughters from my town, who read the book says : "The 
 whole book savors of unfairness and even bitterness toward the South. 
 
 Another lady said : "Muzzey's History should not be taught any 
 American child. It is unfair to the noble traditions of the South from 
 beginning to end. Our children should know the truth about their 
 Southland and not be taught to feel his ancestors were fools and traitors.

 Mothers should look into the histories taught their children. Experience 
 has shown we cannot leave too much to the teacher, trained often in 
 Northern institutions." 
 
 To quote from the book itself. In speaking of secession and election 
 of Abraham Lincoln it says : "Not one of the five Northern Presidents, 
 since Jackson's day, (Van Buren, Harrison, Filmore, Pierce, Buchanan) 
 had shown the slightest hostility toward slavery, while in the White 
 House and the last two had been completely dominated by Jefferson 
 Davis and other radical pro-slavery statesmen." And again, in one of 
 the closing paragraphs, we find these words, "It is impossible for the 
 student of history today to feel otherwise than that the cause for which 
 the South fought the War of 1861-1865 was an unworthy cause, and 
 that the victory of the South would have been a calamity for every 
 section of our country." (Page 467). 
 
 Do we, as Daughters of the Confederacy, want the youth of the 
 Southland to study this history, or any other, which smacks with such 
 unfairness ? 
 
 A criticism has come from one of the publishers to the effect that 
 "If the Daughters would get toegther and stay together long enough 
 to put their choice before the people, they could run any Governor or 
 State Superintendent away from Raleigh for failure to respect their 
 choice." 
 
 The State Historian moved that the Daughters give their 
 support in eliminating this history from the schools. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams moved that Mrs. Harvey be made 
 chairman of a committee to come before the General Conven- 
 tion to urge the discontinuance of ]\Iuzzey's history. Carried. 
 
 The President called for reports of the Executive Committee, 
 which were read by the Recording Secretary. 
 
 MEETING OF EXECUTIVE BOARD NORTH CAROLINA 
 DIVISION, U. D. C. 
 
 Asheville, April 6, 1920. 
 The Executive Board of the North Carolina Division U. D. C. met 
 on April the 6th, at Battery Park Hotel, Asheville, Mrs. C. F. Harvey 
 presiding. 
 
 The object of this meeting was to plan for the Convention in New 
 Bern, in October, and the affairs of the Division. 
 
 The following resolutions were offered and endorsed by the Board 
 on the death of Gen. R. H. Ricks : 
 
 General Robert H. Ricks 
 It is with deep sorrow the Executive Board of the North Carolina 
 Division U. D. C. records the death of Brig. Gen. Robert H. Ricks,

 which occurred February 19, 1920 at his home near Rocky Mount, N. C. 
 His record as a soldier of the Confederacy especially endeared him to 
 the hearts of the "Daughters." 
 
 He enlisted at the beginning of the war, being one of the six volun- 
 teers to burn the barn at Bethel with Henry Wyatt, one of the many 
 heroic acts of the Confederacy. He served fearlessly 'till the end. 
 
 His devotion to the cause of the Confederacy and to the interests 
 of the U. D. C. was earnest and substantial. 
 
 His money and his time were freely placed at the command of those 
 who sought to keep green the memories of the South's heroes. 
 
 He donated a large sum of money to finance the writing of a history 
 of North Carolina's part in the War Between the States, and in every 
 way showed intense State pride and patriotism. 
 
 His warm hearted character showed itself in many deeds of charity. 
 The Division mourns his death and will ever reverence and honor the 
 memory of this brave soldier, who "wore the Grey and followed Lee 
 to Appomattox." 
 
 Mbs. John H. Anderson, 
 Mrs. Fred A. Woodard, 
 Mrs. S. N. Harrell. 
 
 Letters were read from the civic organizations of Asheville offering 
 co-operation and support in entertaining the General Division in Novem- 
 ber, 1920, and greetings extended to the Executive Board. These were 
 accepted with much appreciation. 
 
 Mrs. Strayhorn, Director of Children's Work offered the financial 
 assistance of the Children's Chapters, and it was unanimously decided 
 that six children should be chosen from the six Children's Chapters 
 in the Division doing the best work to act as pages for the General 
 Convention. 
 
 The Recording Secretary was instructed to send letters of apprecia- 
 tion to the Committee on Arrangements for the beautiful banquet 
 given in honor of the Executive Board, former Presidents and mem- 
 bers of the Division.

 Daughters of the Confederacy met on Tuesday afternoon, October 12, 
 1920, after a beautiful luncheon given by Mrs. Thomas G. Hyman,

 this especially interesting by giving account of our work, facts from

 Mrs. J. F. Hayden, First Vice-President, gave the following 
 report : 
 
 Madame President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 It gives me pleasure to make the following report; and it has been 
 indeed a great privilege to have been associated with such a splendid 
 body of officers. 
 
 While regretting exceedingly the absence of our President, I was 
 very glad to take greetings from our Division to the Federation of 
 Women's Clubs at Charlotte in May. Conflicting dates prevented her 
 from being there. 
 
 As custodian of the Division Song, "Our Stars and Bars Will Live 
 Forever" will say the sale has been slow ; but after all very gratifying. 
 I have collected to date $104.20 and have on my books $18.10 yet unpaid 
 by Chapters which ordered copies sent out. I have mailed Mrs. Long 
 check for $100.00, leaving on hand a balance of $4.20. I sent post cards 
 to every Chapter President urging the sale, also to most of the leaders 
 of Children's Chapters. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. J. F. Hayden, 
 First Vice-President. 
 
 Accepted with thanks.

 REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN'S CHAPTERS 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 It is my pleasure to bring you the report of work of the Children 
 of the Confederacy for the past year. Owing to the fact that, acting 
 under the instructions of our Third Vice-President General, Mrs. Holt, 
 we have been trying to get all Chapters properly registered, according 
 to the new rule, it is impossible to make this report tally in member- 
 ship with preivous reports. We now have fifty-six chapters, but only 
 about thirty-five active. However, some of the sleeping ones have 
 decided to wake up, and reorganize. I have registered 627 this year, 
 of these 363 are new. I am glad to report we have enrolled five new 
 Chapters. 
 
 I have issued 200 Certificates. The children have contributed 
 through me $32.00 towards the General Convention fund, and some of 
 them have sent contributions direct to Mrs. Long. I have attended 
 three District meetings, one of which was entertained by a Children's 
 Chapter, and at another the program was largely given by the chil- 
 dren. The essays for the C. of C. prizes show much thought, and 
 careful preparation, and are well worthy of mention. I hope these 
 prizes will be continued.

 Although the work has not gone forward as rapidly as we would 
 like to see it, yet we have every reason to feel encouraged, and the 
 outlook for 1920-21 is very bright indeed. I would like to impress on 
 the mother Chapters the importance of organizing new Chapters where 
 there are none, and of encouraging those already organized, for the 
 children of today will be the daughters and sons of tomorrow, and 
 soon it will fall to them to keep alive the traditions we hold so dear. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. H. G. Strayhorn, 
 Director of Children's Chapters. 
 
 Accepted with thanks. 
 
 Mrs. John L. Bridgers asked the privilege of showing a hand- 
 some banner which was sent by the children of the Dixie Lee 
 Chapter, Tarboro, with the request that it be hung behind the 
 President's chair in Convention. It was reveived with a great 
 deal of appreciation. 
 
 Mrs. J. M. Gudger, Jr., was called upon for her report as 
 Second Vice-President, but was not in the Convention hall. 
 
 The report of Mrs. Lila R. Barnwell, Third Vice-President, 
 was read in her absence. 
 
 REPORT OF THIRD VICE-PRESIDENT AND STATE 
 PUBLICITY CHAIRMAN 
 My duties as Third Vice-President have been few indeed, and for the 
 most part consisted in agreeing with valuable suggestions made by our 
 capable President. 
 
 In my own section I have been especially interested in securing histor- 
 ical information for our local Chapter. 
 
 As Chairman of the Publicity Committee I have written fortj^ letters 
 and articles to various persons and publications. Manj^ of these were 
 typewritten communications of several pages, and consisted of accounts 
 of Chapter work. District activities, poems etc. 
 
 I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to all those who so 
 kindly assisted me in this important work, and trust that they have 
 from time to time seen their information appearing in our leading 
 State papers and The Confederate Veteran. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. Lila R. Barnwell. 
 Duly accepted. 
 
 The Recording Secretary called the roll and the reports of 
 each Chapter present were read as its name was called.

 Memorial. 
 
 She offered the following as a resolution from the committee : 
 
 "Whereas, the North Carolina Division of the Daughters of the 
 Confederacy, the United Confederate Veterans, and the Sons of Vet- 
 erans, have decided that the first Confederate flag, our beloved Stars 
 and Bars, was designed by Maj. Orren Randolph Smith, the first 
 unfurled at Louisburg, North Carolina. 
 
 "In our opinion it is the privilege and duty of the North Carolina 
 Division of the Daughters of the Confederacy to erect on this spot or 
 as near as possible to this spot, where this flag was unfurled, a suitable 
 memorial setting forth these facts. 
 
 "We, therefore, suggest that the various Chapters contribute to a fund 
 for this purpose, and that the President of this Division appoint a 
 committee to see to the collection of this fund, to procuring the memo- 
 rial for the unveiling of this memorial at Louisburg during the coming 
 spring or summer, for the erection of such a memorial and that the 
 President of this Division appoint a committee to see to the collection 
 of this monej-, to procuring this memorial or marker, and to arranging 
 for the unveiling of the same during the coming year at Louisburg." 
 
 This was accepted by the Convention.

 REPORT OF THE WORLD WAR RECORD DIRECTOR 
 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 I bring you the year's report of the World War Records and want to 
 thank those that have made the effort to collect these records for the 
 use of future generations. 
 
 I have this year written twenty-nine cards and seventy-seven letters; 
 have sent out 209 circular letters.

 Have copied the 962 blanks of last year for the General Files and have 
 them all filed in the loose leaf binders for the State. Now as soon as the 
 medals are ready you will have the records so that you will have very 
 little trouble. 
 
 Have received records from forty-one Chapters, if some of them did 
 send just one. 
 
 I hope another year you will think more about this work and don't 
 wait until the last of the year for that makes it so hard on your 
 Director, but start on it as soon as 3'ou go home.

 REPORT OF STATIONERY COMMITTEE 
 
 For the first time since being appointed chairman of this committee, 
 some fifteen years ago, I am compelled to apologize for work done, or 
 rather left undone. 
 
 For the past year your Chairman has been out of the printing business. 
 Up to that time she could hand in a piece of work and see that it was 
 completed, but alas times have changed and once in the hands of printers, 
 no one can say when the work will be finished. 
 
 Orders were given at first to a printer, who had worked for us for 
 years, and were promptly filled. Then he sold out and the new man 
 held up the work for months, to finally turn it over to another party. 
 So it has been 'till your Chairman has worn out in trying in vain to get 
 work done, and most gladly will turn it over to her successor, wishing 
 her God speed with printers. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Fannie Ransom Williams, 
 
 Chairman.

 Chapter Presidents of the Division. Mrs, Haywood's report 
 was as follows : 
 
 REPORT OF SOLDIERS' HOME COMMITTEE 
 Madam Chairman and Ladies of the Convention: 
 
 In coming to you with my report as Chairman of the Soldiers' Home 
 Committee, I am very sensible both of the great honor and great respon- 
 sibility that is mine. Since receiving in November this appointment, 
 I have given its work and its advancement my first thought and con- 
 sideration, hoping to make the result of my efforts worthy to run along 
 with the high ambitions entertained by pur President for the good that 
 should result from the active co-operation of each and every Chapter 
 in the State in the welfare of the Soldiers' Home, through the ofifices 
 of this Chairmanship. 
 
 In all my efforts to further these ambitions, I have striven to guide 
 my activities by a first hand knowledge of the wishes and desire of my 
 friends — the men who live at the Plome, for from my school girl days, 
 these men in Gray who live in the old rambling gray house under the 
 big oaks at the head of New Bern Avenue have stood second to none 
 in appeal to my sentiment and my sympathy, and far back, I can 
 remember the big lawn party that the women of Raleigh gave in Nash 
 Square, when the old house first opened its doors as a Home, and in 
 my memory will live forever the unflagging devotion and resourcefulness 
 with which those wonderful women worked, that its every room might 
 be well and comfortably furnished and North Carolina's gratitude for 
 services she could never repay fittingly expressed. 
 
 And throughout the years just past, I have fought and prayed that 
 this expression might be re-established in all the beauty of its first 
 embodiment, and the work of our mothers passed a living torch of love 
 and understanding from generation to generation. To that end, I have 
 asked for your interest and your money, have husbanded the one and 
 spent the other as fast as you could send it in. Time stops for none 
 of us. This is an opportunity for service that will never renew itself. 
 It behooves us to make haste to be kind. Time drags when shadows 
 grow bent with the years; and home is where the heart is at peace. I 
 am afraid that of late years, there has been much of the bite of fine 
 irony in applying to the gray old building in Raleigh the name by which 
 we have known it. I know many of the men well, and I find that many 
 of them still guard as their most cherished possession that fine essence 
 of self respect that stills indiscriminate complaint; to get the confidence 
 of these men, you have to cultivate their friendship. You have heard 
 much about complaints of conditions at the Home; you have not heard 
 half the men might have told and haven't. 
 
 Twenty-seven cities of this State have Chapters which, when the

54 Minutes of the Twenty-fourth Annual Convention 
 
 Home was opened or since have furnished rooms there. These are, 
 Concord, Dunn, Durham, Edenton, Fayetteville, Gastonia, Goldsboio, 
 Hertford, Kinston, Laurinburg, Lenoir, Lexington, Morganton, Mount 
 Olive, New Bern, Pittsboro, Raleigh, Red Springs, Rocky Mount, Salis- 
 bury, Scotland Neck, Shelby, Warsaw, Wilson, Winston-Salem. There 
 are besides these a total of seven bed-rooms bearing names of different 
 memorials; the sun parlor. Orange County Memorial, and the library, 
 the L. O'B. Branch Memorial which have been furnished and adopted. 
 
 The rooms adopted, together with the sun parlor, receiption room, 
 linen rooms, now used as bed room, and the twenty-five cottage rooms 
 never adopted, total sixty-four. 
 
 It was to the work of replenishing the furnishing of such of these 
 rooms as time had made necessary, and the providing of comforts for 
 such of them as had none, that I planned with your President on taking 
 up my office to first turn your attention. To this end, I began my visits 
 of inspection at the Home, and my inquiries at first hand of the men 
 as to their needs and desires, for it seemed to me that through no 
 other method could we build up with integrity the work I was planning 
 to ask you to undertake. And the knowledge I in this way arrived at 
 gave me pause — for it seemed to me it would profit a man little for 
 me to ask you to send a wash stand, blanket or bedside rug for his 
 room — when his soul's desire was set on getting a place of peace for 
 that soul, and the roof mended above his head, so that he might not 
 in the middle of the night have to pull his bed out of the rain. And, 
 as the months went by, it began to look as if the job of removing the 
 obstacle in the way of getting the roof mended and other essentials of 
 happiness established at the Home was to prove a hopeless one. But, 
 of late, far reaching and radical changes have been made and whereas 
 the material situation still leaves much to be desired, I can come to you 
 now with a clear conscience and urge that each Chapter get in immediate 
 touch with me and further with all its energy this plan of our Pres- 
 ident's for contributing for the comfort of the Home. For, I confidently 
 believe through co-operation in the plans of General Carr, which I 
 shall presently read you, we shall see the speedy fulfillment of many 
 things that will make for greater happiness at the Home. 
 
 It gives me great pleasure to here return thanks to you for your 
 most generous and speedy response to my appeal to you at Christmas. 
 Never for years has the Home seen such a party as your generosity 
 provided, apples we bought by the barrel, oranges by the box, and 
 candies by the hundred pounds. The men walked around the open 
 boxes with bags and helped themselves as they saw fit. Those were the 
 days when only two meals were served a day at the Home, but we had 
 supper and a roaring fire on Christmas night. For the making of this 
 feast we received :

 All that was left of our Christmas money, and other money given me 
 personally, we spent in February during the flu epidemic for hot water 
 bottles, $14.00 for six blankets and three overcoats $51.00, for 12 chairs, 
 $40.00, for fruit $17.00. Some contributions directed to the Home, have 
 not passed through our hands. 
 
 During the winter, we received many comforting gifts that supple- 
 mented these donations, from Miss Maggie Wickers, of Sanford, Miss 
 Ida Wilkins, and Mrs. Junius Daniel of Wilson, knitted sweaters and 
 socks. And sweaters and socks from Mrs. Thomas Lewis, President 
 Gastonia Chapter; books from D. J. Currie, of Jackson Springs. In 
 February $50.00 to be spent for the comfort of the flu sufferers, from 
 Mrs. Harvey, and $50.00 through Colonel Olds, from Miss Esther Ran- 
 som, to be turned to the purchase of a moving picture machine. In 
 the spring, most liberal donation of towels, sheets, blankets, and bed 
 spreads from the Gastonia Chapter. In October, $125.00 from District 
 No. 14, collected by Mrs. Hughes, for operation expenses for an old 
 veteran; $50.00 from the J. B. Gordon Chapter for the A. B. Gowell 
 Memorial room. $25.00 from the R. F. Hoke Chapter, Salisbury, and 
 $50.00 from the Bethel Heroes Chapter of Rocky Mount for their 
 respective rooms. Overcoats, clothes, and tobacco from the Boys' 
 Chapter of Winston-Salem, barrel of apples from the Boys of the 
 Zeb Vance Chapter of Gastonia. 
 
 We have with us a supplementary report, the location, adoption and 
 arrangement of the differeent rooms, by which we will be glad to answer 
 questions when this session is adjourned. Many of the living arrange-

 ments need re-organization ; the sanitary arrangements are crude, in 
 one of two instances, barbarous, but some of the Chapters, Rocky Mount, 
 Salisbury, Gastonia, and Winston-Salem, have already set their hands 
 to the task of blazing a trail back to the comforts of the old days with 
 that faith that from time immemorial has removed mountains. 
 
 These things are most encouraging for whereas my work has never 
 reached the high aspirations of your President, I feel that her revival 
 of this Chairmanship has been eminently worth while. For comforting 
 fires now burn in the open gratis of the living rooms at the Home 
 when mornings are cool and the psychological atmosphere grows daily 
 more the sustaining one you would wish it to be. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Martha Haywood, Chairman. 
 
 Miss Haywood's report for the committee was accepted with 
 thanks. Miss Haywood also read a message from Gen. Julian 
 S. Carr, President of the Soldiers Home, in which he made 
 suggestions which he thought would be of benefit to the Home. 
 Mrs. I. W. Faison expressed appreciation of General Carr's 
 message and moved that his suggestions be acted on later. Mrs, 
 Henry A. London and Mrs. C. Felix Harvey both spoke in 
 appreciation of Miss Haywood's deep interest in and splendid 
 work for the Soldiers Home. 
 
 The report of the Advisory Board of the Confederate Wo- 
 men's Home was read by the chairman, Mrs. Hunter G. Smith, 
 and was accepted with thanks. 
 
 REPORT OF CONFEDERATE WOMEN'S HOME. 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 It is with a grateful heart as Chairman of the Home that I present 
 my report for the past year's work, for in time of need the U. D. C. 
 Chapters of North Carolina heard the cry and responded liberally. 
 There are few, if any Chapters in the State that have not contributed 
 in some way to the comfort of the ladies in the Home this year. 
 
 The nurse fund, which you created in our last Convention, has been 
 a perfect God-send to the sick and suffering, for with the available 
 appropriation a nurse would have been impossible. We have employed 
 a trained nurse in some cases, but we have now employed a good, prac- 
 tical colored nurse, who is meeting the need, and proving a great 
 comfort to our feeble family. 
 
 I am very glad to report that the special session of the General 
 Assembly through the Council of State allowed five thousand dollars 
 to meet the present indebtedness of the Home, and to be used for 
 maintenance until the January session of the Legislature, when an

United Daughter's of the Confederacy 57 
 
 increased appropriation of $1,500 or $2,000 will be asked for. And 
 realizing the valuable assistance rendered by the U. D. C. women of the 
 State speaking to their respective represntatives through the request of 
 our very zealous President, Mrs. Harvey, and Chairman of Pensions, 
 Mrs. Winstead, and having a committee present in Raleigh in August 
 at the special session of the Legislature, the Board of Directors requests 
 me to ask the incoming President to follow the well laid plans and have 
 a strong committee of ladies meet with them in Raleigh at the next 
 meeting of the Legislature and use their influence for the increased 
 appropriation. This Home is to be perpetuated as a home for deserving 
 Confederate women. The Board also wishes me to say that we can 
 care for several more ladies in the Home, and will be glad to welcome 
 them. 
 
 I have had the five markers placed at the graves with your permission. 
 There has been one death since our last meeting — that of Mrs. Caldwell. 
 There are a number quite feeble. 
 
 We have added to the Home a very large refrigerator at a cost of 
 $165.00, which is a great comfort and convenience, the gift of Districts 
 No. 4 and 5. At the request of Miss Mary Henderson I advanced the 
 money, and ordered the refrigerator in June. 
 
 In conclusion let me thank our President, Mrs. Harvey, for the loyal 
 support and deep interest she has taken in the Home and the comfort 
 of the ladies. 
 
 And again thank the Chapters for what I consider their greatest 
 year's work for the Home, for the response to "Come over and help 
 us" has been general throughout the Division, and their loyal support 
 to the women of the Sixties has been beautiful, for which they are 
 deeply grateful, and we throw wide open the doors of the Confederate 
 Women's Home to any deserving Confederate woman, assured that the 
 true and tried U. D. C. of North Carolina will ever be their shield and 
 buckler. 
 
 And no greater epitaph could be written of us than that we planted 
 the flowers of mirth and joy in the hearts of others. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. Hunter G. Smith, Chairman.

 REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF CONFEDERATE WOMEN'S 
 
 HOME 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 I have written to the President of each Chapter explaining our needs 
 and asking that they see their Senators and Representatives, urging 
 them to procure from the State an additional appropriation for our 
 Confederate Women's Home, also asking that each Chapter send as soon 
 as possible, generous boxes and checks to tide over the shortage until 
 the State can act. Our Senator and Representative from Edgecombe 
 have promised to aid us as far as possible. 
 
 Our Chapter, William Dorsey Pender, has already sent a check for 
 $30.00, and a box valued at $125.00. 
 
 Respectfully submitted,

 It is with pleasure I bring to you the splendid report for the Nurse's 
 Fund of Confederate Home. We have had need for this fund more 
 than ever, as we have had sickness and feebleness all the time in the 
 Home. It should be a great pleasure to each of you who contributed 
 so generously to it to know that you have made the sick room brighter, 
 and the weary hours easier to bear, by placing skilled hands at the 
 disposal of our dear old ladies.

 Mrs. J. F. Hayden, First Vice-President, was called to the

 REPORT OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE 
 
 A report of the educational activities of the Chapters for the past 
 year cannot give a detailed account of all the things accomplished by 
 these several Chapters. The spirit of the members at work is often 
 greater than the material results that can be included in a report. 
 
 Perhaps, the greatest single good accomplished is the encouragement 
 of the study of the lives of our Confederate heroes, thus stimulating an 
 interest on the part of the young people to cherish our history, which is 
 glorious and world renown, and to respect and reverence our heroes 
 who have achieved universal fame. 
 
 The work should be enlarged until every schoolhouse shall have on its 
 walls a portrait and a brief account of the services of Southern leaders. 
 It would create future interest to have the portrait and a brief study 
 of the local Confederate veterans who helped to rebuild their community 
 and their State after the war. The young people should be taught to 
 cherish the memories of those who have been community and State 
 builders. 
 
 The Stonewall Jackson Chapter of Charlotte has set a good example 
 particularly in this respect. Seven portraits of our heroes were given 
 to the schools during the past year through the activities of this Chap- 
 ter. 
 


## p. 65 (#423) #############################################

United Daughters of the Confederacy 65 
 
 Gastonia has set a fine example in another respect. The high school 
 pupils of that county wrote fifty essays last year on subjects dealing 
 with Confederate history, and a silver loving cup was presented to the 
 Chapter making the best all round historical report. This county also 
 gave a ten dollar gold piece for the best reminiscenses from a woman 
 of the Confederacy and another ten dollar gold piece for the best 
 reminiscences from a man of the Confederacy. The reminiscences 
 should be preserved for they will help the historian in the future to 
 give correct interpretations of the spirit of the South. 
 
 It is also very interesting to report that the Chapters are not neglecting 
 the heroes of the recent World War. In addition to contributing to the 
 Hero Fund, prizes have been offered to high school pupils for essays 
 on the World War. Enfield has set a good example in this respect by 
 giving a medal to the high school pupil for the best essay on a soldier 
 descendant of a Confederate veteran who served in the World War. 
 
 The Chapters have been active in donating books to libraries. I feel 
 quite sure that if all the Chapters had reported in full we could have 
 made a much finer showing. 
 
 The Transylvania Chapter seems to have led all the rest in this 
 respect. The number of books contributed to the libraries was over 
 one hundred. These are evidences that the Chapters are very active in 
 educating the general pubHc in the history and traditions of the State 
 and of the South. Many Chapters not mentioned here are just as 
 active. Both the small and the large are alive with a fine spirit. 
 
 During the year two letters were sent out by the Chairman asking the 
 Chapters to make contributions to the "Hero Fund" and to provide for 
 the scholarships for which the Division and the Chapters are respon- 
 sible. About fifty of the Chapters have reported to the Chairman and 
 a summary is given below. No report of the "Hero Fund" is given in 
 this report since it will probably appear in the Treasurer's report. 
 
 Division Scholarships 
 
 The scholarships supported by the North Carolina Division for 1919-20 
 and the value of each are as follows :

 1 Albemarle Chapter 50.00 
 
 3 Transylvania Chapter 72.00 
 
 2 Trinity College, Durham at $50.00 each 100.00 
 
 The prizes, medals, portraits and books given by the Chapters are 
 
 as follows : 
 
 8 prizes $ 51.00 
 
 7 medals 35.00 
 
 16 portraits 70.00 
 
 152 Volumes contributed to libraries 300.00 
 
 Many requests have come to this committee for scholarships showing 
 that the U. D. C. can be of great help to many sons and daughters of 
 our Confederate veterans if the funds are available. The Division 
 should adopt some uniform policy for providing the funds to pay for 
 these scholarships. I suggest that annual dues be levied on all members 
 of the several Chapters and that this fund be collected and forwarded 
 to the State Treasury to be known as "A Scholarship Fund" for the 
 Division. In addition to this the "Hero Fund" should be increased 
 until the Division has fully met its obligation. The annual dues neces- 
 sary to meet these needs may be determined by ascertaining the total 
 membership and then the amount necessary may be apportioned among 
 the Chapters. 
 
 This has been a good year and every Chapter should make a resolu- 
 tion not only to continue the fine work but to make full and complete 
 reports so that all may profit from the services of each. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. E. C. Brooks, Chairman. 
 
 It was moved and carried that the report be accepted with 
 thanks. 
 
 The President called on Mrs. Henry A. London, former 
 chairman, regarding the $111.00 now in the treasury to the 
 credit of the Chapel Hill Monument, which was unveiled in 
 1912. Mrs. London stated that this sum was from tardy Chap- 
 ter pledges to this monument and that she had been assured 
 that all expenses connected with this had been met. After some 
 discussion it was moved and carried that any unexpended bal- 
 ance on hand to the credit of this monument fund (all indebted- 
 ness being paid) be turned over to the Educational Fund.

 REPORT OF COMMITTEE FOR UNVEILING TABLETS AT 
 WINCHESTER 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the North Carolina Division: 
 On Page 59 of the Charlotte Minutes 1915, can be found one of the 
 
 most important resolutions ever made and carried out by the North 
 
 Carolina Division, U. D. C. 
 It is fitting that this resolution be incorporated in this, the final and 
 
 complete report of the work just finished. The resolution reads as 
 
 follows : 
 
 "Resolved : That the U. D. C. hereby make the suggestion to the 
 State Historical Commission, the propriety of its marking the places in 
 the Valley of Virginia near Winchester, where Generals Pettigrew and 
 Ramseur died ; these places being unknown generally to the people of 
 these respective communities. Both places were visited by Col. Benehan 
 Cameron this summer — directions being obtained by him from prominent 
 and reliable parties who visited the two generals during their last hours. 
 General Pettigrew died in the house of Boyd. General Ramseur in the 
 house of Hite." 
 
 When one has erected a house, the last task is to have it swept and 
 the windows opened to the sunshine. Therefore it becomes my greatest 
 pleasure to bring to you the final report on the above resolution. You 
 can point with great pride to these tablets, which were presented at 
 the Wilson Convention and unveiled on the 16th and 17th of September, 
 1920, in a land that contains more Confederate graves than any other, 
 a land of battlefields, a land of monuments. 
 
 They shall stand as reminders to all future generations that they may 
 pause and see what these men have wrought, for what courage and 
 patriotism they stood. 
 
 All nature was aglow and gave its perfect weather for this occasion. 
 The hills and valleys round about, that once ran riot with the blood of 
 brave men, were clothed in gorgeous colors of richest Autumnal beauty. 
 Thirty-seven loyal and true North Carolinians journeyed there to per- 
 form their duty to these two immortal heroes. 
 
 Among them the only daughter of Maj. Gen. Ramseur, who was a 
 babe of only a few days, when her father before having even seen her, 
 was called upon to lay his life on the altar of his country. Miss Mary 
 Ramseur. 
 
 The monument to the memory of Maj. Gen. Stephen Dodson Ramseur, 
 who was mortally wounded in the battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, 
 1864, was unveiled and dedicated on the 16th of September, 1920.

 This Monument stands on the highway at the entrance of the Shen- 
 andoah Valley. The Tablet bears this inscription : 
 
 "Northeast of this tablet, 800 yards is the Belle Grove house, 
 in which died October 20, 1864, Maj. Gen. Stephen Dodson 
 Ramsuer, C. S. A. A native of North Carolina, he resigned 
 from the United States Army in 1861 and entering the Con- 
 federate States Army as a Lieutenant, rose to the rank of 
 Major General at the age of 27. 
 
 ERECTED 1918 BY 
 
 THE NORTH CAROLINA HISTORICAL COMMISSION 
 
 AND 
 
 THE NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION U. D. C." 
 
 These monuments are exactly alike. Two polished granite pillars 
 were presented by Col. Peter H. Mayo, of Richmond, Va. who died just 
 before the completion. 
 
 In addition to the Tablets, the organization of U. D. C.-U. C. V. and 
 the Historical Commission furnished the granite bases. The cannon 
 balls placed on the top were furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, 
 Hon. Josephus Daniels, from the Portsmouth, Va., Navy Yard. 
 
 The ceremonies were presided over by Mrs. C. Felix Harvey, Preui- 
 dent of the North Carolina Division U. D. C. with the following

 reception in honor of the North Carolina visitors. 
 
 On the afternoon of the 17th, the same faithful party journeyed to 
 the Boyd house at Bunker Hill, West Virginia, for the purpose of 
 unveiling and dedicating the monument to Brigadier-General James 
 Johnston Pettigrew. The people of this vicinity, as the day before, 
 turned out almost en masse to again greet the visitors and to participate 
 in these exercises. Hundreds of people motored from Winchester, 
 including the Confederate Camp, the U. D. C. Chapter of Berkeley 
 County and Martinsburg. 
 
 The exercises were held at the monument, which stands in a conspicu- 
 ous place, near the Winchester-Martinsburg turnpike, the same road 
 over which Stonewall Jackson's men and horses hauled Baltimore and 
 Ohio Railroad engines to Winchester during the early part of the war.

 It is with a heart singing with gladness that I bring to you this report 
 of work completed. Also wish to make the following recommendations :

 this valuable information and who with untiring energy labored to the 
 fulfillment of this work. 
 
 2. To Mr. R. D. W. Connor for his interest and aid as representa- 
 tive of the State Historical Commission. 
 
 3. That one also be written to the citizens of Winchester, the Chap- 
 ter U. D. C. of that city for the splendid entertainment and consider- 
 ation given the North Carolina delegation during its sojourn there. 
 Also special mention be given of Mrs. Conrad for her beautiful enter- 
 tainment and gift to the Carolinians of the L. O. B. Branch flag. This 
 note to be sent the paper of Winchester which also deserves mention. 
 
 4. A note of thanks be sent Secretary Daniels and the family of the 
 late Mr. Mayo, and the owners that so cheerfully gave the spots on 
 which the monuments are erected. 
 
 Too much honor cannot be paid these soldiers of the Southland. In 
 honoring them we honor ourselves. 
 
 For how can a man die better than facing 
 
 fearful odds. 
 For the sake of the fathers and the altars 
 
 of his Gods.

 THE REPORT OF THE VICE-REGENT OF THE NORTH 
 CAROLINA ROOM IN RICHMOND. 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confeederacy: 
 
 I send greetings from the officers and members of The Confederate 
 Museum, and only regret that I cannot deliver them in person. Since 
 my last report some of our most faithful workers have been called to 
 their Heavenly Home. We sustained an irreparable loss in the death 
 of Mrs. Enders Robinson who had been a most efficient officer in the 
 Museum for more than twenty years. The passing of these loyal 
 members reminds us that we must hasten the work and try to fully 
 endow the Museum during this generation. The younger women will 
 be more interested in the heroes of the World War and we must see 
 that the valiant deeds of our beloved Confederate Veterans are pre- 
 served for all time. 
 
 The Museum has become one of the chief places of historical interest 
 in Richmond and is visited by many distinguished people each year, 
 among them last spring was General John Pershing and staff. At 
 my request he wrote his name in our guest book as a compliment to 
 the famous North Carolina Regiment that helped him break the Hinden- 
 burg Line. In October, the representatives of the Sulgrave Institute 
 and Pilgrim Fathers from England and Massachusetts will be our 
 guests, when they make their pilgrimage to Jamestown in commemora- 
 tion of the first white settlement in this country in 1607. 
 
 The Museum has become quite a factor in educating the youth of 
 this city, as every Saturday the school children have the privilege of 
 coming with their teacher, who instructs them in the true history of 
 the War Between the States. More than five hundred children visited 
 the Museum last year, and over eight thousand other guests were reg- 
 istered. 
 
 Our relics grow fewer every year, but through our ever-watchful 
 Regent, Mrs. Johnson, we received a book entitled "The Five White 
 Brothers in the Confederate Army," by Cordelia White Phifer. The 
 book is unique, as it is the one and only edition, hand printed by Miss 
 Phifer's own hand in black with red and gold ornamentations. It is 
 artistically bound in red suede with gold lettering. It contains a copy 
 of original letters now in Miss Phifer's possession of her five uncles 
 to their family, written while in active service from the battlefield.

 As true historical data the book is invaluable, and we deeply appre- 
 ciate this rare gift. The North Carolina Room is richer by many other 
 gifts from Miss Phifer, who has always manifested the greatest interest 
 in the Museum, for which we sincerely thank her. 
 
 Your President, Mrs. Harvey, has continued the good custom estab- 
 lished by Mrs. Thrash of sending the minutes of the North Carolina 
 Division handsomely bound in Confederate Gray. I want to urge the 
 Daughters to get both life and annual members for the Museum and 
 to have the rolls of honor filled in. 
 
 Your Regent, Mrs. Johnson, told you last year we found it necessary to 
 increase the endowment of our room to five thousand dollars. I hope 
 the State Legislature will continue their apropriation of two hundred 
 dollars for several more years, and all of the life memberships you 
 secure go to this fund also. We are indebted to Mr. W. S. Forbes, a 
 former North Carolinian, now residing in Richmond for a recent gift of 
 one hundred dollars, and to Major John Motley Morehead for fifty 
 dollars. This brings our endowment up to three thousand six hundred 
 fifty dollars. All of last year's interest, one hundred twenty dollars, 
 was used for necessary expenses, as you will see from my financial 
 statement below. 
 
 Thanking you for your untiring loyalty and support in this sacred 
 work, I am

 tleman, Col. Thomas T. Kenan, who was known and loved by so many 
 of the Daughters. This makes the endowment fund now $3,750.00. 
 
 These reports were accepted with thanks.

 Chapter, the $5.00 prize offered by her for the greatest number

 I. W. Faison moved that a rising vote of thanks be given Mrs. 
 Holt for the work she has done. Motion carried. 
 
 The report of the Gettysburg Monument committee was made 
 by the chairman, Mrs. Marshall Williams, and accepted. 
 
 REPORT OF GETTYSBURG MONUMENT COMMITTEE 
 
 Since last we met, it has been the good fortune of your Chairman to 
 visit the battlefield of Gettysburg. 
 
 As the guide led us up to the "bloody angle" and pointed to the spot 
 of danger furtherest into the enemy's line — and said "the 26th North 
 Carolinian were found dead here" — your Chairman felt a glow of pride 
 at their fearless charge — and then — she felt ashamed the Old North 
 State had placed no suitable marker of appreciation. 
 
 This spot is visited by millions, natives and foreigners, for Gettysburg 
 is the best cared for battlefield in the world, with sixteen thousand 
 acres and seven million dollars worth of monuments. 
 
 Let me urge you to make your donations larger. Special thanks are 
 due Gastonia. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams, Chairman. 
 
 Mrs. I. W. Faison moved that the North Carolina Division 
 take for its main work during the coming year the placing of 
 markers and monuments at Gettysburg in commemoration of 
 the North Carolina soldiers who shed their blood on that battle- 
 field. After much interesting discussion the motion was carried. 
 
 Mrs. J. L. Bridges read a telegram from Mrs. Mercer of 
 Edgecombe County, in regard to moving the remains of Miss 
 Annie Carter Lee from North Carolina to Virginia, as proposed 
 by the ^'irginia Division. It was moved and carried that the 
 regular business be suspended so that this matter be attended to 
 at once. 
 
 The Recording Secretary read a letter from Mr. Howard F. 
 Jones of Warrenton, which had been sent to the Convention 
 regarding this matter. Mr. Jones offered to "dedicate in trust 
 to the North Carolina Division, U. D. C, the four acres of land 
 surrounding the Jones Family Burial Plot in which Miss Lee 
 was buried, so that the grave of General Lee's daughter would 
 be cared for through the coming years." He stated that a com-

 mittee from the Lexington, Va., Chapter, U. D. C, had recently 
 visited and inspected this grave. That this committee stated 
 to him that they would have to make an unfavorable report, 
 and that there was strong feeling in Virginia for removing the 
 body to Lexington to lie beside her father. There was much 
 discussion following the reading of this letter, and great appre- 
 ciation was expressed for Mr. Jones' interest in a matter near 
 the hearts of the North Carolina Daughters of the Confederacy. 
 
 Mrs. Fannie M. Williams moved that the North Carolina 
 Division notify the Virginia Division, U. D. C, that the North 
 Carolina Division will not allow the removal of Annie Carter 
 Lee's body from North Carolina soil, the letter of notification to 
 be written by Mrs. Harvey. Mrs. Fore proposed that the 
 motion be amended by adding that the North Carolina Division 
 refused to allow the removal of Annie Carter Lee's body 
 because General Lee had expressed his desire that the body be 
 undisturbd, and that a copy of General Lee's letter expressing 
 that desire be enclosed. The motion as amended was carried. 
 
 It was moved by Mrs. B. L. Tyree that provision be made 
 by the North Carolina Division, U. D. C, to place in perpetual 
 care the grave of Miss Annie Carter Lee. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Eugene Glenn moved that the North Carolina Division 
 authorize the chairman of the Sanatorium Committee to draw 
 from the treasury sufficient funds for the free bed at the Sana- 
 torium, Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Eugene Glenn of Asheville, in the absence of the chair- 
 man, Mrs. Reid, read the report of the Committee on Feasibility 
 for Establishing Bed at Tuberculosis Sanatorium. 
 
 REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FREE BED FUND 
 
 Madam President and Friends: 
 
 Isn't it fine to have things turn out better than we expect them to? I 
 confess that I proposed the idea of the Daughters supporting a free 
 bed at the State Sanitorium for tuberculosis, with fear and trembling. 
 
 The response for this call has far surpassed my expectations. We 
 asked for $365.00, and we have received $508.04. I like to think of the 
 good will and loving hearts that lie back of these gifts, and it warms 
 my very heart to think of the renewed hope and life it will make 
 possible in the lives of many an afflicted one. We reecommend : 
 


## p. 78 (#436) #############################################

78 Minutes of the Twenty-fourth Annual Convention 
 
 First, that this money be used to support a free bed at Sanatorium. 
 My understanding is that this will cost $365.00 a year. We further 
 recommend that the excess funds be carried over on the next year's 
 expenses. 
 
 Second, that a committee be appointed to work with Dr. McBrayer 
 in selecting applicants for the free treatment, that preference be given 
 to descendants of veterans, but not necessarily confined to them, as we 
 wish the bed occupied all the time by some needy person.

 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CHURCH BELLS

 churches patriotically, gave their bells to the Confederate Government 
 to be cast into cannon. This is a valuable and beautiful bit of history 
 that, if not attended to now, will be forgotten. 
 
 In Hillsboro, North Carolina, the Baptist and Presbyterian churches 
 gave their bells. St. Matthews Episcopal Church also gave its bell. 
 After the war, this was replaced by a Memorial Bell given by Mrs. M. 
 A. Curtis in memory of her son, John Henry Curtis, killed at the 
 Battle of Bentonville. 
 
 The Methodist and Episcopal Churches of Greenville, N. C, gave 
 their bells. 
 
 The churches in Nashville, N. C, did not give their bells, but the 
 Yankees desecrated all of the churches — burning some of them, and so 
 seriously injuring the Methodist Church, that the United States Govern- 
 ment paid for these injuries after the war. While one of the churches 
 burned, its bell mournfully tolled out its sorrow for such vandalism. 
 
 Edenton, North Carolina, has the honor of four cannon that were 
 cast from the bells in that vicinity; and became the "Edenton Bell 
 Battery," an artillery organization in the service of the Confederate 
 States of America. St. Paul's Episcopal Church bell, Methodist Church 
 bell, hotel bell, school bell were all given the government and cast into 
 four cannon, named respectively "The St. Paul", "The Fanny Roulhac," 
 "The Columbia" and the "Edenton." The rector of St. Paul's has two 
 "grape shot" balls that were fired by the St. Paul cannon. These four 
 cannon formed the battery that protected the sound from Yankee gun 
 boats. 
 
 Weldon, in 1861, had only a little union church with no bell of its 
 own, using the railroad shed bell for call to service. But the little 
 chapel was used all through the war for a hospital for our wounded. 
 
 The Washington, N. C, churches all gave their bells. The Roman 
 Catholic and Presbyterian Churches were burned by the Yankees, while 
 the Episcopal Church was desecrated and used for Yankee barracks. 
 
 The bell of St. John's Episcopal Church in Fayetteville, N. C, was 
 offered to the government by its vestry, April 1862, but was not accepted. 
 The bell of the Presbyterian Church of Fayetteville was offered by the 
 session of the church in April 1862, but was not accepted on account 
 of difficulty of transportation. 
 
 The churches of Halifax, N. C, gave their bells. Mr. Thomas Pol- 
 lock of that town had given a bell for the servant's chapel, and, when 
 the "call" came for bell metal, they offered their bell and it was sent 
 on with the other bells. 
 
 St. Bartholomew's Church of Pittsboro offered its bell in 1862, but 
 being far from a railroad, it was not accepted. 
 
 Calvary Episcopal Church and all of the other churches in Tarboro, 
 N. C, gave their bells to the Confederate Government.

 I quote an incident bearing on the subject: When the Federals 
 occupied Wilmington after the Battle of Fort Fisher, Dr. Watson, 
 rector of St. James' Church (later bishop), was commanded to pray for 
 the President of the United States instead of the Confederate States. 
 He refused to do so. Whereupon, by order of General Schofield, the 
 keys of the church were seized, the church ordered closed for Divine 
 worship, the pews and pulpit torn out by negroes with pick axes, and 
 the church turned into a hospital, although its members offered other 
 more suitable places, and begged him to spare their beloved church. 
 A venerable lady of the congregation wrote a lament over it, using 
 the 79th Psalm as the text. 
 
 During the war all that was portable of the Norfolk Navy Yard was 
 moved to Charlotte, N. C, in May 1862, and guns and gun carriages and 
 fittings were made there. When bells were asked for by the government, 
 the bell of the First Presbyterian Church, in Charlotte, was given. 
 After the war, it was replaced by a larger bell with the inscription on it, 
 giving the history of the first bell. St. Peter's Episcopal Church, the 
 Baptist, Methodist, Roman Catholic, and in short all of the Charlotte 
 churches gave their bells, which were melted into cannon for Brem's 
 Battery, a Charlotte artillery organization. Almost the entire battery 
 was lost at the Battle of New Bern. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. Henry A. London, Chairman. 
 
 Mrs. Cherry of Greenville gave a touching reminiscence of 
 the church bells in her town, as well as a very interesting per- 
 sonal reminiscence of Jefferson Davis. 
 
 Mrs. Harvey stated that at the General Convention the 
 President General spoke of the splendid historical data that this 
 Church Bells Committee would furnish. 
 
 It was proposed by Mrs. W. A. B. Branch that a vote of 
 thanks be given to Mrs. Harvey for her generosity in giving 
 the Division insignia. 
 
 Mrs. Peter Gorrell extended a cordial invitation to the 
 Convention to meet next year in Winston-Salem, which was 
 endorsed by Mrs. James Norfleet of Winston-Salem. This 
 invitation was heartily accepted. 
 
 On motion the session adjourned at 5 o'clock.

82 Minutes of the Twenty-fourth Annual Convention 
 
 THIRD DAY— Morning Session 
 
 The President called the Convention to order at 9:30 a. m., 
 Mrs. M. O. Winstead giving the invocation. The Secretary 
 read the minutes of the previous day, which were accepted. 
 The Musical Director sang "The Stars and Bars." 
 
 The report of the committee for Rebecca Winborne marker 
 was read by the chairman, Mrs. Winstead, and was accepted. 
 
 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE REBECCA WIN- 
 BORNE MARKER 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 We, the Committee of the Rebecca Winborne Marker, beg to submit 
 the following report : 
 
 At the last Convention of the North Carolina Division U. D. C, 
 which met at High Point, it was voted by this Convention that the U. D. 
 Cs of North Carolina should place a marker at the grave of Mrs. 
 Rebecca Winborne which is in the cemetery at Wilson, N. C. 
 
 We all remember that Mrs. Winborne made the first Confederate 
 Flag — the flag that was designed by Maj. Owen Randolph Smith — and 
 was accepted by the Confederate Congress as the insignia of its new 
 government. It is most fitting that the Daughters of North Carolina 
 should do themselves honor by marking the grave of this patriotic 
 woman. 
 
 Feeling that a speedy response would come from all Chapters in 
 the State to this cause, we did not, until about the first of March, make 
 any appeal. At that time we sent to every Chapter in the State a circular 
 letter setting forth the purpose of the appeal, and asking that every 
 Chapter send something — not more than twenty-five dollars, and not 
 less than one dollar — expecting and wishing that we would receive at 
 least two hundred and fifty dollars. Much to our surprise and disap- 
 pointmeut only fifty-three Chapters in the State have responded at all — 
 giving altogether one hundred dollars and fifty cents. Two individuals 
 have contributed one dollar each, and two Chapters in Washington City 
 (through a request of Miss Jessica Smith) have contributed eight dol- 
 lars. The Hilary Herbert Chapter giving five dollars and the Dixie 
 giving three dollars. This makes a total of $106.50 for this fund in the 
 Treasurer's hands. Of this amount five Chapters in the State have 
 given five dollars each; one Chapter has given ten dollars (the Pres. 
 Chapter) two Chapters have given three dollars each ; one Chapter two 
 and one-half dollars ; five Chapters two dollars each, one Chapter one 
 dollar and seventy-five cents, and all other contributing Chapters sent 
 one dollar and less. It is a great disappointment not to have had this 
 marker placed and a photograph of the same here to show this Con-

 vention, but on account of the small receipts, we are unable to do so. 
 We have, however, a sketch of the design, secured by a member of this 
 Committee, Mrs. Walter F. Woodard, from a firm in Petersburg, who 
 agrees to place this marker in September of this year for $175.00. We 
 feel that this design and the inscription to be placed on it is most appro- 
 priate, but if we could add to the cost of this marker as much as $75.00 
 more, we could have a much handsomer and larger one, and I believe 
 the Daughters would feel more their efforts. 
 
 We believe the wrong impression had gone out among the Chapters 
 as to the amount they were expected to give, or we would have a much 
 larger fund than we now have. We still have faith in the Daughters of 
 North Carolina and believe they desire to place a becoming marker at 
 the grave of our Flag Maker. Therefore we again ask that you raise 
 two hundred and fifty dollars for this purpose. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. W. O. Winstead, Chairman. 
 
 The chairman thanked those who had worked for this object 
 and upon asking for an increase in the subscriptions, the fol- 
 lowing were made: 
 
 Mrs. Gudger, $5.00; Bethel Heroes, $5.00; Jr. Bethel Heroes, $5.00; 
 High Point, $2.50; Fannie Patton Chapter, $2.00; Sanders Holt, $1.00; 
 Emaline Pigot, $5.00; John D. Whitford, $5.00; Washington, $5.00;

 Robert E. Lee, Children, $2.00; Dixie Lee, $2.00; Louisburg, $5.00; 
 Stonewall Jackson, $5.00; A. M. Waddell, $5.00; Beaufort, $5.00; Wil- 
 liam Dorsey Pender, $2.00; Children's Chapter, Wilson, $5.00; John 
 W. Dunham, $5.00. 
 
 The report of the Committee on Appropriations and Pensions 
 was read by the chairman, Mrs. Winstead, and was accepted 
 with thanks. 
 
 REPORT OF THE APPROPRL'\TIONS AND PENSION 
 COMMITTEE 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 After listening to the report of the Confederate Women's Home at 
 the last Convention, as given by Mrs. Hunter Smith, it was decided by 
 the President and the members of that Convention, that a petition 
 should go to the Legislature at its extra session in the summer, for an 
 increased appropriation for this Home. 
 
 Your President made a strong appeal to all the Chapters, asking them 
 to see their respective Representatives in behalf of this appropriation 
 for the Home.

84 Minutes of the Twenty-fourth Annual Convention 
 
 She also sent to each member of the Appropriation Committee a 
 request for their influence in behalf of the same. Your Chairman also 
 wrote to each member of the Appropriation Committee a personal 
 letter, asking their support to this appropriation. 
 
 Several encouraging letters were received from members of this 
 Committee. 
 
 At the request of the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. 
 Geo. M. Rose, several members of this Committee, with the President 
 and other Daughters, met in Raleigh on the 11th of August, the day 
 after the convening of the Legislature, for the purpose of petitioning 
 the Appropriation Committee for an increased appropriation for the 
 Confederate Women's Home — especially did they need an emergency 
 fund to meet the much needed bills that were due. 
 
 The result of this visit to Raleigh was that the Appropriation Com- 
 mittee assured the Directors of the Home that they would empower 
 the Governor to make the needed appropriation for the Home for the 
 present time, as it was not expedient for them to make appropriation at 
 an extra session of the Legislature. Therefore it will be necessary for 
 a committee from the U. D. C's, with the Directors of the Home to 
 go before the next Legislature at its regular session and petition for 
 a sufficient appropriation to maintain the Home as it should be, and also 
 to give the Confederate soldiers an increased pension. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. W. O. Winstead, Chairman. 
 
 Mrs. Eugene Glenn moved that the Division if possible 
 endorse the request of Mrs. Johanna Semple, who for four 
 years served in the Confederate Treasury, that she be paid back 
 pensions by the Legislature. Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that 
 the Division also endorse the payment of back pensions to Mrs. 
 Belle Ibell Wilfong, of Newton. Both were carried. 
 
 Mrs. I. W. Faison was called to the rostrum to read the sug- 
 gestions made by General Carr in his letter to the Convention 
 regarding the Soldiers' Home. 
 
 It is as follows : 
 
 Durham, N. C, September 29, 1912. 
 Mrs. Harvey, 
 
 State President United Daughters of Confederacy, 
 New Bern, N. C. 
 Dear Mrs. Harvey : 
 
 Feeling that the Soldiers' Home is an institution peculiarly an object 
 of care and solicitude to the Daughters of the Confederacy, I, as Pres- 
 ident of the Home, ask to make report to your most worthy bodJ^

United Daughters of the Confederacy 85 
 
 Pardon, please, a personal reference. I organized the Soldiers' Home 
 and was its first President for a term of eight years, when my business 
 compelled me to resign the presidency of the Home, but ever since I 
 have been a member of the board. 
 
 I know of no influence that can be brought to bear upon our Legis- 
 lature that would accomplish more than the Daughters of the Con- 
 federacy and especially since now you have the ballot, thank God, and 
 this leads me to suggest that the approaching General Assembly be asked 
 to enact such legislation as will require that the Vice-President of the 
 Board of Trustees be the President of the Daughters of the Confed- 
 eracy of the State. 
 
 My wish is to bring about a closer bond of fellowship betwixt the 
 Soldiers' Home and the Daughters of the Confederacy of the State. To 
 this end I suggest that at this meeting of your honorable body a Visiting 
 Committee of three or five be appointed to visit the Home at least once 
 a year, inspect its management and be authorized to make such report 
 to the Board of Managers or Trustees of the Home as in their wise 
 judgment they may see fit. 
 
 Pardon another suggestion. I feel that it would be both wise and 
 proper if your Convention would appoint a Legislative Committee to 
 aid and assist the Trustees in perfecting such legislation before the 
 Legislature as the Trustees and your Honorable Board deem worthy 
 and needful. 
 
 Memorandum of the conditions and situation at the North Carolina 
 Soldiers' Home as reported by Supt. D. H. Milton under date of Sep- 
 tember 29, 1912 : 
 
 Number of men on roll, 155. 
 
 Number admitted from Decist to September 29th, 42. 
 
 Number died at the Home from December 1st to September 29th, 28. 
 
 Number died at home on furloughs, 3. 
 
 The hospital has 37 inmates. 
 
 Discharged, 1. 
 
 Amount of appropriation, $45,000.00. 
 
 So long as I am President of the Home, I hope every year to make 
 a report to this Honorable Convention. 
 
 With distinguished consideration and esteem, I beg to remain, 
 
 Respectfully yours, 
 
 Julian S. Carr. 
 
 In conformity with these suggestions, it was moved and 
 carried that the North CaroHna Division, U. D. C, request the 
 Legislature to appoint the President of the North Carolina 
 Division, U. D. C, as Vice-President of the Board of Trustees 
 of the Soldiers' Home.

 REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON "WOMEN SOUTH" BOOK 
 
 Madam President and Daughters: 
 
 I have this year written and sent out one hundred and ten letters 
 about our book, "The Women of the South in War Times." 
 
 When I sent out my letters I had the hopes of having the books to 
 deliver at this Convention but now the Committee thinks it best to wait 
 until General Convention so each Chapter is entitled to one book at 
 the first price of $1.50, that is if that amount is in my hands before 
 November 1. If any of you want to get this book you can get it before 
 November 1 for $2.00 if the money is sent to me by November 1, after 
 that they will be $2.50.

 It was moved and carried that the President authorize the 
 Treasurer to pay the pledge for $106.45 made at Louisville, Ky.,

 Mrs. Fannie M. Williams, chairman of the Committee on

 REPORT OF PRESIDENT'S BADGE AND EX-PRESIDENT'S 
 BAR COMMITTEE 
 
 Pursuant to your wishes at the High Point Convention, your com- 
 mittee at once took up the matter of securing this badge and the 
 thirteen needed bars for the "Exs" so they might be presented at the 
 New Bern Convention. 
 
 Our ideas of both badge and bars were given to our "Court Painter 
 of the North Carolina Division," Mrs. Marshall Williams, and from 
 these ideas she drew the beautiful designs for both. It was then 
 decided to have Paul-Gale-Greenwood, Norfolk, Va., make the bars, 
 and another of the committee, Mrs. Jacksie Daniel Thrash, offered to 
 personally see these jewelers and secure prices and also see to the 
 designing of the bars from drawings sent. 
 
 As a result of this conference in April your Chairman received the 
 color sketches of badge and bars, also cost of both, and at once sub- 
 mitted same to each of the committee for approval. All the com- 
 mittee, save one, agreed to the same design, and the order was then 
 given and the entire number received in June. The bars each bear the 
 owner's name on the back and on the front the words "President N. C. 
 U. D. C." also date when she served.

United Daughters of the Confederacy 89 
 
 Thirteen of the bars were ordered, there having been eleven Ex- 
 Presidents, our presiding officer will this Convention become an "Ex," 
 and a bar for her successor. 
 
 The beautiful President's Badge is a gift to the Division from our 
 honored President, Mrs. Felix Harvey, and bears on the back this 
 inscription, "Presented to the North Carolina Division by Mrs. C. 
 Felix Harvey 1920." It is also to Mrs. Harvey that the Division is 
 indebted for a large part of the cost of the "Bars," as she donated -dl 
 her expenses to the Tampa General Convention for this purpose. 
 
 Arrangements have been made with the jewelers to keep the die of 
 our Ex-President's Bar, and each retiring President should secure the 
 Bar for her successor and present it at the close of her term of office 
 to the new incumbent. 
 
 With the handing you, Madam President, this bar, our task is finished 
 and we trust the Badge and Bars will meet with your full approval and 
 I move the dismissal of our committee.

 Mrs. Fannie Ransom Williams, Chairman.

 Mrs. James M. Gudger, chairman of the Dixie Highway 
 Commission, made a report for her committee, which was 
 accepted. Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that the North Carolina 
 Division postpone action in the matter of the highway until 
 after the meeting of the General Convention. Carried. 
 
 REPORT OF DIXIE HIGHWAY COMMISSION 
 
 No action has been taken by this Commission except at the Tampa 
 Convention the following resolution was offered : 
 
 "Resolved, That the United Daughters of the Confederacy, in Con- 
 vention assembled, hereby endorse a movement to place bronze markers 
 along the route of the Dixie Highway, the design to be a bronze tablet 
 with the bust of Gen. Robt. E. Lee in bas-relief, same to be placed on 
 boulders at the intersection of each State line. 
 
 "The inscription to be : 'Dedicated in loving memory to the South's 
 greatest hero. Gen. Robt. E. Lee, by the United Daughters of the 
 Confederacy.' " 
 
 This resolution was referred to the executive committee to investigate 
 and report at the General Convention in Asheville.

 The following report of Peace Prize Committee was read : 
 
 REPORT OF PEACE PRIZE COMMITTEE 
 
 As Chairman of this State for the consideration of Essays contesting 
 for the Peace Prize I received six, and these were carefully examined 
 by a committee of three, a high school principal, a prominent lawyer, 
 and the vice-president of the Woman's Club. They were unanimous 
 in their decision, that of Mary Copeland Blythe of Brevard, N. C, being 
 of the highest merit in their estimation. 
 
 The essays were at once sent to Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson at 
 Greenwood, Miss., according to instructions previously received. To my 
 surprise they were returned to me with the information that Mrs. Hen- 
 derson was no longer General Chairman, and I was told to send them 
 to a lady in Tennessee. This I did as promptly as possible. Mrs. Roy 
 McKinney kindly interested herself in the matter, and had the time of 
 consideration extended for a month. 
 
 At a meeting of the Executive Board in Asheville last April Mrs. 
 Thrash of Tarboro generously offered a prize of $25.00 to the writer of 
 the best essay from North Carolina, provided the essayist had not 
 received a prize from the entire organization of the U. D. C. 
 
 If possible it would be very gratifying to have this settled at the 
 meeting of the General Convention which meets in Asheville in 
 November. 
 
 Respectfully, 
 
 LiLA Ripley Barnweu-, 
 State Chairman of the Peace Committee. 
 
 Ehily accepted. 
 
 The President brought up the proposition made by Dr. Henry 
 Louis Smith on Historical Evening regarding the raising of a 
 Lee Memorial fund. 
 
 The Secretary was requested to read the resolution as pre- 
 pared by Dr. Smith, which is as follows : 
 
 "The North Carolina Division of the U. D. C. recognizes the desira- 
 bility of providing a suitable custodian of the Lee Chapel and Mauso- 
 leum and of also enlarging the building and protecting it from risk of 
 destruction from fire. 
 
 "It regards the raising of a Lee Memorial fund for this and kindred 
 purposes as a valuable means of perpetuating and disseminating the 
 principles and ideals of the Old South which culminated in the matchless 
 character of its great leader. 
 
 "It also approves the plan adopted of raising this fund through the 
 distribution of an illustrated Lee Memorial booklet, and recommends

United Daughters of the Confederacy 91 
 
 the movement to the favorable consideration and co-operation of all 
 its members." 
 
 Great enthusiasm was shown in regard to this proposition, 
 which received an immediate adoption. Many subscriptions 
 were offered from the floor for this object. 
 
 In view of the fact that General Lee and thirty of the Lees 
 were buried at Lexington, after the adoption of this resolution 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that her motion of the previous 
 day be rescinded, in regard to Miss Annie Carter Lee's grave. 
 
 She then offered the following motion : 
 
 That the North Carolina Division offer to look tenderly after the 
 grave of Annie Carter Lee in North Carolina but should Virginia desire 
 that her remains be laid at Lexington beside her illustrious father and 
 ancestors then in that case the North Carolina Division will tenderly 
 disinter her and send her to Virginia. 
 
 Motion carried. 
 
 Mrs. Fore, author of the Children's U. D. C. Catechism, 
 made some suggestions regarding these catechisms. In accord- 
 ance with these suggestions Mrs. F. M. WilHams moved that 
 all moneys from these catechisms over and above the cost of 
 her printing, be used as a nucleus for a historical fund, and that 
 no changes be made in the catechism unless first approved by 
 Mrs. Fore. Motion carried. 
 
 Upon request, Mrs. F. M. WilHams, Registrar General, 
 explained the question of registration and urged the great 
 necessity of getting this straight. She explained : First, that a 
 daughter cannot be a member of more than one Chapter, but 
 she can obtain a demit from one Chapter to another ; second, 
 that a Daughter cannot hold ofifice in a Chapter when her mem- 
 bership has not been transferred to the same ; third, that since 
 the Tampa Convention, it was decided that no Daughter can 
 be received into a Chapter until her paper is returned to her 
 with the Registrar General's name upon it — until this is received 
 she is simply a visitor. Mrs. Williams also stated she was 
 giving in the General Convention two prizes, one for the Divi- 
 sion that sends her the most applications, and the other for the 
 Chapter in the Division that sends her in first a complete record 
 of all of the members on the roll.

92 Minutes of the Twenty-fointh Annual Convention 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that a committee of five be 
 appointed to revise the constitution and submit to the General 
 Committee on Constitution and report complete revision at the 
 1921 Convention. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Williams made some suggestions regarding registration 
 which were followed by much discussion. Mrs. Waddell moved 
 that the discussion of information regarding registration be held 
 in a committee room for the benefit of the Registrars and that 
 the general business proceed. Motion carried. Mrs. Williams 
 stated that some errors had been made in the old minutes and 
 moved that the following corrections be made : 
 
 All application blanks, whether for old or new members, 
 must be sent to the Division Registrar. Where old members 
 have to be registered copies of their papers are all that is needed. 
 No certificate, whether new or a duplicate, can date back of the 
 date when issued by the Registrar General in office at the time. 
 No registration of old members can date back, but date of 
 admission is retained on back of application. 
 
 No demit is legal except the form requiring the applicant's 
 record. No written demit is legal at any time. 
 
 Division Registrars must sign and forward all their papers 
 to Registrar General and no member can be invited as such to 
 a Chapter meeting, nor dues received from her until her appli- 
 cation is returned signed by the Registrar General. 
 
 Cousins-in-law and great-great-nieces are strictly illegal and 
 Chapter Registrars should not receive them. 
 
 Mrs. L. E. Fisher moved that a committee be appointed to 
 urge Congress to have the names of our Southern heroes, Lee 
 and Jackson, inscribed in the Memorial Theatre for the heroes 
 of the country at Arlington. Motion carried. 
 
 Mrs. Andrew Faulkner made the following resolution : 
 
 "That the North Carolina Daughters of the Confederacy 
 heartily endorse the work of the Near East Relief among the 
 orphans of Armenia and Syria ; that we pledge our support 
 of the movement to relieve all sufifering among the women of 
 the stricken territory." It was moved and carried that this be 
 done. 
 
 Mrs. I. W. Faison read the following resolution : 
 


## p. 93 (#451) #############################################

United Daughters of the Confederacy 93 
 
 "Resolved that we of the South remember that Memorial 
 Day originated in the South immediately after the War between 
 the States and we most urgently urge that this term always be 
 used instead of Decoration Day, the name adopted by the 
 North." 
 
 It was moved and carried that this resolution be adopted, and 
 taken to the General Convention. 
 
 Mrs. Fisher moved : 
 
 That the North Carolina Division require applicants for membership 
 who are married to give maiden name and the married name. 
 
 That Chapter Registrars be required to file all membership papers 
 accepted by the State Registrar, signed and returned by State Registrar 
 to Chapter. 
 
 That, since a law which was enacted by our general organization at 
 the Louisville Convention requiring three papers of application for 
 membership, one of which must be filed by the State, it has become 
 necessary to inaugurate a new system of keeping our State records, our 
 State Registrar be authorized to buy such loose leaf binders as she 
 deems necessary to keep a correct list and record of the members of the 
 Division. 
 
 Acted upon ad seriatim and carried. 
 
 Mrs. E. S. Clayton, chairman of the State Division for the 
 Entertainment of the General Convention in Asheville, made a 
 report of their plans, as follows : 
 
 At the request of our President, Mrs. Harvey, I make the following 
 report of plans for the General Convention, which meets in Asheville 
 November 9th. My first intention was to give you only a glimpse into 
 what we were doing that you might have a glad surprise but after 
 realizing that you are joint hostess with the local Chapters we felt we 
 must go into full detail. When the State officials met in Asheville, April 
 6th, several selections were made of persons to be in charge of arrange- 
 ments for Convention. We ef¥ected the organization of the local Exec- 
 utive Board on May 26th, since which time we have had meetings at 
 regular intervals, at first four, then two weeks apart. We then organ- 
 ized sixteen committees, under the management of a very efficient 
 chairman and vice chairman for each committee. Each chairman was 
 given the privilege of selecting her own committee, consequently they 
 are formed of the most active and enthusiastic members of the two 
 Chapters. We have sent two thousand bulletins into the various States 
 that are interested in our work. Transportation and hotel committees

 have completed plans to render every possible aid to the visiting dele- 
 gates and they hope all Daughters as they arrive will not hesitate to 
 command their services. In addition to this the hospitality committee 
 will look after the comfort and pleasure of every one attending the 
 Convention. The committee on entertainment have arranged for an 
 organ recital and tea at Grove Park Inn Tuesday afternoon, Pages 
 ball Tuesday night at Grove Park, general reception Wednesday evening 
 at Battery Park, luncheon Thursday at Battery Park, automobile drive 
 Thursday afternoon to various points of interest in and around Ashe- 
 ville. The program is in the hands of a most capable committee under 
 the direction of the President General and State President. A number 
 of distinguished guests are expected to be in attendance and add much 
 to the brilliancy of the entertainment. The music committee has 
 engaged an orchestra for two evenings, with bugles on welcome evening 
 to create the enthusiasm which is so much desired. There will also be 
 many selections of vocal and instrumental solos appropriate to the 
 various meetings. Leaders of the Children's Chapters are preparing for 
 a flag drill which will be very beautiful. 
 
 The finance committee has worked hard and most successfully, having 
 accomplished the desired results. They are now perfecting plans to have 
 at least two automobiles in waiting at each meeting, to be used by those 
 attending Convention for all emergencies. These cars will be decorated 
 in flags to distinguish them. All organizations of the city have offered 
 their services to assist in every way possible and are much interested 
 in making this the most successful and charming General Convention 
 that has ever been held and we will not stop short of that goal. 
 
 In the name of the local Chapters I wish to extend a most cordial 
 and pressing invitation to you and your friends to come to our beautiful 
 mountain city and assist us in making this a great and glorious 
 occasion. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. E. S. Clayton, 
 General Local Chairman. 
 
 Mrs. Clayton's report was adopted with a vote of thanks of 
 appreciation to her and her committee for their work. 
 
 Mrs. Gudger, chairman of the HospitaHty Committee, asked 
 the retiring Executive Board, the new President and officers, 
 and all of the Past Presidents to serve on the Hospitality Com- 
 mittee at the General Convention in Asheville. Mrs. Harvey 
 accepted with pleasure on behalf of all.

 REPORT OF COURTESY COMMITTEE 
 
 Assembled in our Twenty-fourth Annual Convention in historic old 
 New Bern where the women of the sixties have passed on to the 
 women of today their most precious secret, that of charming hospitality, 
 and where the men of all ages have been the willing slaves of these 
 women, we, the members of the North Carolina Division U. D. C, wish 
 to express our hearty appreciation of the numberless courtesies of our 
 hosts. 
 
 Happy in its conception and perfect in every detail was the beautiful 
 banquet tendered us by the Chamber of Commerce. 
 
 Mrs. Hyman's inspiring address of welcome from the New Bern 
 Chapter and her untiring efforts in our behalf have won our deepest 
 gratitude. 
 
 To Mrs. Nixon, president of the Woman's Club, to Mrs. Gaskins of 
 the Order of the Eastern Star, to Mayor Dills, and to Mr. Moore of 
 the Chamber of Commerce and to Commander Street of the New Bern 
 Camp of Confederate Veterans we extend thanks for their cordiality. 
 
 To Mrs. Hayden for her response in our behalf, to Mrs. A. M. Waddell 
 for greetings from the Colonial Dames of North Carolina, to Mrs. 
 Josephus Daniels whose presence is always an inspiration to North 
 Carolina women, to Mrs. Bickett whom we ever delight to honor and 
 to Dr. Henry Louis Smith for his masterly address we wish to express 
 our appreciation. 
 
 The Elks, the Shriners who so exquisitely decorated the Sudan 
 Temple, the officers of the Methodist and Episcopal churches and of 
 the high school, whose rooms we used, have also contributed much to 
 our comfort and pleasure. 
 
 The delicious lunches given us by the Woman's Club and the New 
 Bern Chapter U. D. C, and the brilliant reception tendered by the 
 Order of the Eastern Star will linger among our pleasantest memories. 
 
 Especially would we give a word of deep appreciation to the pretty 
 children who carried us back to our own old South on the tide of their 
 sweet voices, to the bevy of charming and beautiful pages who served 
 us so faithfully, to the ministers who led our devotional exercises and to 
 the press of New Bern for its kindness. 
 
 And we would add another word of enduring love for our splendid

 DISTRICT REPORTS 
 
 District No. 5 
 
 District Number 5 North Carolina Division U. D. C. held its annual 
 meeting on Jefiferson Davis' birthday, June 3rd, at Thomasville. 
 
 A new precedent was established at this meeting, as the hostess 
 Chapter was the Thomasville Grays, Children of the Confederacy. This 
 is the first time that a Chapter of the Children of the Confederacy has 
 ever entertained a district meeting, and our charming and enthusiastic 
 young hostess, gay in white frocks sashed with red, would have made 
 any meeting a success. The children proved an inspiration, for Salis- 
 bury has determined to revive its Children's Chapter this fall. 
 
 After a delightful luncheon served by the children, the meeting was 
 called to order by Mrs. H. G. Strayborne of Thomasville, the District 
 Director having resigned. 
 
 Mrs. G. T. C. Cochrane acted as secretary. China Grove, Salisbury, 
 Lexington, Thomasville and High Point were represented. All made 
 full and extremely interesting reports, making the most of the unlimited 
 time allowed reports at District Meetings. A round table discussion of 
 methods for arousing interest and raising money followed. In this 
 informal way many helpful suggestions were brought out. Lexington 
 emphasized especially the value of a carefully worked out yearly 
 program with an attractive year book issued to each member. Seventy- 
 four new members were reported. 
 
 Our tireless and able State President, Mrs. C. F. Harvey, spoke, giving 
 us a new vision of the possibilities of District work. She was fresh 
 from Fayetteville, and asked our aid in filling any one of several urgent 
 needs. The Fifth District decided to place a refrigerator in the Home. 
 As one large enough to meet all future needs was desired, costing 
 $165.00 the Fourth District offered to halve expenses with us. The 
 refrigerator was secured and installed within the month. 
 
 Mrs. J. F. Hayden, our efficient First Vice-President, was present and 
 took orders for our Division song. Salisbury invited the District to 
 hold its next meeting there and asked that the Children's Chapter also 
 send representatives. Miss Mary Henderson was elected District 
 Director. 
 
 We particularly enjoyed the delightful musical program. Our meeting 
 closed with "Our Own Stars and Bars Will Live Forever" sung by the 
 children. 
 
 I expect to meet with all Chapters of the District during the year. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mary F. Henderson, 
 
 District Director.

 District No. 6 
 
 As Director of the Sixth District of the United Daughters of the 
 Confederacy, which District is composed of the cities of Greensboro, 
 Graham, Burlington, Reidsville, and Leaksville-Spray, I am pleased to 
 report a most delightful District meeting. The Burlington Chapter 
 enteratined the meeting, which was held in the Front Street Methodist 
 Episcopal Church, April 13, 1920. 
 
 Delegates were present from Burlington and Graham. Due to heavy 
 rains the night before, the delegates from Spray who were coming in 
 automobiles could not be with us. Mrs. Dan Hall, president of the 
 Burlington Chapter, presided at the opening session and welcomed the 
 delegates and visitors. An interesting program was presented, consisting 
 of music and addresses. The main feature of the morning session was 
 the splendid address of Mrs. Felix Harvey, President of the North 
 Carolina Division U. D. C, who was presented by the Leader of the 
 Sixth District, Mrs. J. D. Kernodle. 
 
 At noon recess a beautiful luncheon was served by the hostess 
 Chapter. 
 
 In the afternoon session, special emphasis was laid on the importance 
 of the soldiers' record and proper registration of members. The district 
 felt especially proud to have our State President with it. She urged 
 each Chapter to send the 35c per member to help with entertaining 
 the General Convention which meets in Asheville in November. Much 
 inspiration was gained from the wise suggestions, advice and presence of 
 Mrs. Harvey. The District was pleased also to see the interest of the 
 Veterans present and noted with pleasure the activities of the Chapters 
 reporting. 
 
 I have written to each Chapter urging them to meet all pledges 
 promptly, especially taxes and the 3S-cent pledge to Asheville for the 
 General Convention. J have only heard from two Chapters, Graham 
 and Burlington. They report all pledges and dues paid. 
 
 I am still trying to organize a Chapter in Mebane. I feel sure they 
 will soon have a Chapter as they have some members of the Hills- 
 boro Chapter living there who find it inconvenient to attend the meetings 
 of that Chapter. 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. J. D. Kernodle, 
 Sixth District Leader. 
 
 District No. 8 
 
 As District Leader, I take pleasure in submitting to you the following 
 report : 
 
 The annual meeting of District No. 8 of the United Daughters of 
 Confederacy was held in Chapel Hill, April 14, 1920. At eleven o'clock

 the visiting ladies and delegates assembled in the Parrish House, which 
 was appropriately decorated with Confederate flags and cut flowers, and 
 most conspicuous among them was their "Service Flag." 
 
 The meeting was called to order and the session opened by prayer, 
 followed by "America." Mrs. Kenneth Henry, President of the Leon- 
 idas Pope Chapter, in well chosen words welcomed the delegates and 
 visitors. The absence of delegates from the Chapters was regretted. 
 Those present, however, had reports of good work and promises of 
 greater things in the future. 
 
 Mrs. C. Felix Harvey, State President, in her gracious manner, gave 
 a most interesting address on the work of the Division. She told cf 
 the needs in all phases of U. D. C. work. If there were any spirits 
 present that slumbered, I am sure they were awakened to their duty 
 with renewed interest. 
 
 As this District had been without a Director for some time, it was 
 then in order to elect a Director. Mrs. F. D. Manning was then elected 
 District Director. 
 
 Invitation of the Durham Chapter to be hostess in April was accepted, 
 date to be selected by the Director. 
 
 The meeting adjourned after singing "Our Own Stars and Bars." 
 
 A delicious lunch was served by the Daughters, and during this hour 
 the delegates were delightfully entertained by a quartette from the 
 University Glee Club. 
 
 As the day drew to a close and the hour came only too quickly to 
 depart, each delegate returned to her respective home with renewed 
 interest, and feeling they had never spent a happier day, and it would 
 not be long before Chapel Hill would be hostess again.

 Madam President, Members of the Convention, Friends: 
 
 As District Director, I take pleasure in submitting to you the fol- 
 lowing report : The annual meeting of the Ninth District of the North 
 Carolina Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy, was held in 
 Henderson, Thursday, October 7th. The delegates and other visitors, 
 together with the entire membership of the Vance County Chapter of 
 Henderson, were entertained at Renfrew Lodge, the country home of 
 Mrs. S. P. Cooper, Director of the Ninth District, and President of the 
 Vance County Chapter. Forty or more guests were present. 
 The meeting was opened with prayer, and the song "Carolina.'' 
 Mrs. Cooper welcomed the guests to her home, and Mrs. R. G. S. 
 Davis gave greetings from the Vance County Chapter. There were 
 a number of vocal selections by Mrs. F. L. Topleman and Miss Dorothy

 Jones. Interesting reports were given by the representatives of the 
 chapters presents. These reports showed much interest, activity and 
 co-operation in all lines of U. D. C. work. 
 
 The Ninth District is one of the smallest in this organization, having 
 only three small chapters, and one just a very little larger, Oxford, 
 Kittrell, Warrenton and Henderson. 
 
 The chapters represented agreed to assist the Confederate Women's 
 Home, and the Soldiers' Home, especially at Thanksgiving time, with 
 boxes of canned goods, and to contribute to the Rebecca Winburn 
 Marlser fund, and to the Orrin Randolph Smith Memorial fund. 
 
 It gives me pleasure to report that efforts are being made to reorgan- 
 ize an old Henderson chapter — the W. A. Class Chapter — and the 
 organization of a new chapter at Middleburg. Although the application 
 blanks are not yet in the hands of the Registrar, I have received the 
 charter, properly signed and check for the fee of $5.00. The charter 
 has only seven signatures. However, within a few weeks they expect 
 to have a much larger membership, the chapter to be known as the 
 Middleburg Chapter. 
 
 Mrs. J. T. Alderman, member of Vance County Chapter, and a 
 representative of the State Insurance Commission, Raleigh, made a 
 most interesting and helpful talk on Fire Prevention. 
 
 Mrs. Henry Perry gave the poem "Our Apron Flag.'' 
 
 The chapter reports showed an encouraging increase of membership. 
 The majority of names handed in was the result of a very recent 
 membership drive. 
 
 At the close of the business session, short memorial exercises were 
 held in memory of the members that the Ninth District had lost during 
 the year. Mrs. S. T. Peace read a beautiful memorial to Mrs. J. P. 
 Massenburg and Mrs. W. O. Shannon, which was written by her 
 mother, Mrs. W. S. Parker of Henderson, one of the organizers and a 
 former President of this organization — (1907). Mrs. Parker's tribute 
 to Mrs. Shannon was especially fitting. No doubt the majority of you 
 remember Mrs. Shannon — who can forget her ! Although she had her 
 hobbies, she was ever a most devoted Daughter of the Confederacy. 
 
 A most informal and general discussion of the work of the North 
 Carolina Division followed. Ofificers for the ensuing year were not 
 elected. Fortunately the weather was quite cool and delightful. Before 
 the burning oak logs of two fireplaces, small tables were set and 
 luncheon was served. The chill and wind outside was forgotten, and 
 all enjoyed a most delightful social hour, and one that will be long 
 remembered.

 Director of Ninth District, North Carolina Division, U. D. C.

 which he fought under General Pettigrew, fiftj'-seven years ago. It was

 District No. 11 
 
 The annual session of the Eleventh District of the United Daughters 
 of the Confederacy was held Tuesday morning, June 10, 1920, 
 at "Ardlussa," near Fayetteville, N. C. Besides being a very delightftil 
 place in itself "Ardlussa" is a most appropriate place for a meeting of 
 the U. D. C, the picturesque old home, situated in an enormous grove 
 of beautiful shade trees, on the banks of a winding stream six miles 
 south of Fayetteville, was once the home of a Confederate soldier's 
 family, and many interesting incidents connected with the War had 
 their setting here. 
 
 The Chapters of St. Paul, Lumberton, Fayetteville, Dunn and Red 
 Springs were represented in the meeting by delegates who came by 
 automobile. The session was very delightful as well as instructive and 
 beneficial. 
 
 A regular business meeting was held and reports from the several 
 Chapters represented were read, showing good work accomplished by 
 each Chapter. The Alfred Rowland Children's Chapter of Lumberton 
 was represented by a grand-daughter of Captain Alfred Rowland, and 
 her report was of unusual interest. 
 
 Mrs. John H. Anderson, Director of the District, opened the meeting 
 with the U. D. C. Ritual, and gave a very eloquent, instructive and en- 
 tertaining talk in which she discoursed on the five great objects of the 
 U. D. C. She urged the Chapters to take special interest in historical 
 work, and "thereby bring up the youth of the South to remember the

 heroic deeds of their ancestors." The Director reported that the Chap- 
 ter at St. Pauls had been organized. 
 
 Mrs. Anderson announced that she would be unable to sers'e a second 
 term as District Director, owing to her recent election as State Record- 
 ing Secretary, and requested that the District immediately elect another 
 Director to carry on the work, and also suggested that a Secretary be 
 elected. Mrs. Cornelia McMillan of Red Springs was elected to the 
 office of District Director, and Mrs. N. A. Townsend of Dunn was 
 elected District Secretary. Mrs. Anderson expressed the disappoint- 
 ment felt by all the delegates over the inability of Mrs. Harvey, State 
 President, to be at the meeting. 
 
 It was decided that the District should buy a vacuum cleaner for the 
 Confederate Women's Home. Mrs. E. R. McKethan was appointed 
 chairman of this fund, with Mrs. Harlee Townsend's assistance to 
 purchase the cleaner. 
 
 Mrs. Anderson reported that in the list of candidates for the Hall 
 of Fame to be selected this fall, appears the name of Jefferson Davis, 
 among the statesmen of the Nation. The name of Fred Douglas, the 
 negro orator, is also on this list. Mrs. Anderson proposed that this 
 District go on record as urging (through our State President) that 
 our President General take steps to have President Davis' name accepted 
 for the Hall of Fame, and that of Fred Douglas rejected. 
 
 Mrs. Proctor then read a tribute to Jefferson Davis, showing how he 
 had served the Nation as statesman prior to the sixties. Little Miss 
 Thompson of the Lumberton Children's Chapter read a poem, "Songs 
 of Forgotten Men." Mrs. Hunter Smith of Fayetteville gave a report 
 on the Confederate Women's Home, and expressed her appreciation of 
 the gifts from the Chapters of the Eleventh District. Mrs. Smith made 
 an especial appeal to the delegates to urge their representatives in the 
 Legislature to give an increased apropriation for this Home when the 
 request should come before the special session of the Legislature. Mrs. 
 L. T. Townsend, as Chairman of the Nurse's Fund for the Home gave 
 a concise report, and spoke of the need of a nurse to care for the sick. 
 
 Mrs. A. T. West of Fayetteville rendered the Division song, "Our 
 Own Stars and Bars Will Live Forever," accompanied by Miss Jackson 
 of Pittsboro, all joining in the chorus, after which luncheon was served 
 in true Southern style. Short speeches and toast were delivered 
 between courses, and a tribute paid our State President by Mrs. An- 
 derson. Mrs. McEachern, of Red Springs, a real Daughter of the 
 Confederacy, delighted the party Avith reminiscences of the war. Among 
 a number of personal experiences which she recounted, she told the 
 story of a Confederate soldier who came to her home, the present 
 "Ardlussa," tired down from a long day's hike. He was unknown to 
 the family, and as he came in fell unconscious. They took him in the 
 house and shortly afterwards he died, being buried at "Ardlussa." A

 monument was later erected at his grave through the friends of Mrs. 
 McEachern. 
 
 After the kmcheon "The Bonnie Blue Flag,' was sung, and Mrs. 
 McKethan read an article on the life of Harry McArty, author of this 
 Southern song. 
 
 Upon the invitation of Mrs. L. T. Townsend, of the Lumberton 
 Chapter, the District voted to hold its next annual meeting in Lum- 
 berton. 
 
 A rising vote of appreciation was given the retiring Director and 
 her work. With reluctance the meeting then adjourned. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. U. a. Townsend, Secretary, 
 Mrs. J. H. Anderson, Director.

 As retiring District Director, I take pleasure in submitting the fol- 
 lowing report : 
 
 The Twelfth District Meeting of the United Daughters of the Con- 
 federacy was held in the hospitable and progressive town of Mt. Olive, 
 on the 30th of June. The visitors were cordially welcomed at the 
 station and conveyed to the home of Mrs. S. A. Wooten, where a charm- 
 ingly informal reception was held. Immediately following, the business 
 session was called in the school auditorium, which was most appro- 
 priately decorated. The invocation was given by Mrs. A. W. Souther- 
 land. Greetings were extended from the various civic and literary 
 organizations of the town. Delegates from six Chapters of the District 
 were present, giving encouraging reports. 
 
 An increase of membership was reported, nine new members being 
 added. The following worthy causes were presented ; the oragniza- 
 tion of Children's Chapters, an appeal for greater interest from the 
 Senior Chapters in the children's work. It was gratifying to the 
 District to have the delegate of the local Children's Chapter give a 
 most excellent report of a real active Chapter of thirty-seven members. 
 
 Delegates were urged to appeal through their representatives for an 
 increased appropriation for the Women's Home at Fayetteville. A 
 recommendation offered by Mrs. A. W. Southerland that each Chapter 
 have an Educational Chairman, was approved by the District and a 
 motion made and adopted to present this recommendation to the coming 
 State Convention. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams made a strong appeal for the Gettysburg 
 Monument. A most interesting paper on the similarity of the War 
 Between the States and the late war, written by Judge Clark, was read 
 by Miss Winifred Faison.

 Mrs. S. A. Wooten was unanimously elected District Director for the 
 coming year. 
 
 An invitation, extended by Mrs. H. J. Boney, to meet next year with

 A delightful luncheon under the auspices of the local Chapter, was 
 served at the home of Mrs. A. W. Southerland. 
 
 Mrs. Harvey, who could not arrange to be present for the business 
 meeting, made a delightful talk to the Daughters after the luncheon 
 and by her gracious presence made a happy ending of the perfect day.

 deceased veterans, placing ivy wreaths and Confederate flags upon 
 their graves. 
 
 Memorial Day was elaborately observed throughout the District with

 District No. 16 
 
 District No. 16 was without a leader for some time. Last April Mrs. 
 Harvey appointed Mrs. E. L. Catling temporary leader. The leader 
 immediately tried to get in touch with the Chapters comprising the 
 district, namely, Elizabeth City, Edenton, Hertford, Murfreesboro, 
 Merry Hill, Winton, Gatesville and Windsor. 
 
 A meeting was called with the Frank Byrd Chapter, Windsor, in 
 May. This meeting was held in the opera house and luncheon was served 
 in the Club Rooms. A splendid program was rendered including as its 
 main feature a splendid address from the State President, Mrs. Harvey, 
 The Windsor Choral Society furnished music for the occasion. Three 
 Chapters were represented. Merry Hill, W^inton and Windsor. Mrs. 
 E. L. Catling was elected District Leader and Mrs. H. M. Bell, Record- 
 ing Secretary. The next meeting will be in May, 1921, and will De 
 held with the D. H. Hill Chapter, Elizabeth City. 
 
 An effort has been made by the leader to keep in touch with the 
 various Chapters in the District and she hopes to visit each one per- 
 sonally before the meeting in May. We are glad to report the organi- 
 zation of a new Chapter in Aulander. This Chapter is alive and enthu- 
 siastic. We have planned great things for the ensuing year. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. E. L. Catling, District Leader.

 The Chapter continues in its enthusiasm and good fellowship. We 
 have added two new members to our roll of last year, but their taxes

 above mentioned causes and to the Rebecca Winborne Marker and 
 Women's Confederate Home. 
 
 Our pledges of $5.00 to the Educational Fund, $10.00 to the Nurse's 
 fund, $1.00 to General Educational Fund and 50 cents to the General 
 Confederate Women's Work have been paid. 
 
 The Chapter has sent $9.55 on our assessment to defray the expenses

 Monument Fund and for the entertainment of the General Convention 
 in Asheville. The delegate to this convention comes prepared to con-

 making each program interesting. We entertain our veterans once each 
 year, usually on the 10th of May. This year our Chapter entertained

 of ten veterans to reunion at Fayetteville in June. Secured blanks for 
 three to reunion at Houston, Texas, in October. May 10th we held 
 a memorial service to our Confederate dead in which Children's Chapter 
 took part, also Mehegans Boys Band. Then drove to Southwest Creek 
 battleground, where we dedicated a memorial to Gen. R. F. Hoke. 
 Almost entire historical commission was present. They, with county 
 commissioners and A. M. W. Chapter had erected this marker. Besides 
 Judge Walter Clark, Col. Bryan Grimes, Col. F. A. Olds, Mr. R. B. 
 House, State President Mrs. Harvey, State Secretary Mrs. J. F. Taylor, 
 State Chaplain Mrs. F. A. Woodard, we had in attendance descendants 
 of four generals closely associated with this battle, viz. : Mrs. W. D. 
 Pollock, Kinston, and Mrs. Alex Webb, Raleigh, daughters of General 
 Hoke; Dr. D. H. Hill, Raleigh, son of Gen. D. H. Hill; Miss Nellie 
 Heartt, Raleigh, niece of Gen. Braxton Bragg and Miss Annie Whitford 
 Hughes, Pollocksville, daughter of Col. John N. Whitford. After an 
 elaborate dinner, excellent addresses were made by Colonel Grimes, 
 Colonel Olds, Mrs. Harvey and others. Colonel Olds displayed the 
 time-worn flag used by Colonel Whitford in this battle. Miss Frances 
 Pollock recited a poem composed by Mrs. Lillian Archbell in memory 
 of Miss Pollock's grandfather, General Hoke. Then the marker, decor- 
 ated with a lovely wreath, was unveiled by Masters Robert Hoke Webb 
 and Hoke Pollock, grandsons of our illustrious General Hoke. Is it 
 any wonder that this has been the most successful year in our Chap- 
 ter's history with the unexcelled enthusiasm of our Mrs. Harvey as an 
 inspiration ?

 it. Our Chapter plans to place stars on the graves of the World War 
 Soldiers and arrangements have been made for the planting of trees 
 on each side of Main street of our town as a memorial to our World 
 War soldiers. During our County Fair we had a U. D. C. booth from 
 which we realized more than a hundred dollars. We entertained the

 ment and other causes. We have enrolled eight new members, but lost 
 as many from various causes, so our number remains the same. Our 
 veterans at home are our new interest. We are very proud of our 
 little Chapter, named for General Robert Ransom, and Catawba's first to 
 give up his life for the South, St. French Sherrill. We have had only 
 three Presidents since organization in 1903. Our Chapter record in 
 State and General Organization is one for any Chapter to be proud. 
 Our members have been State President, State Recording Secretary, two 
 Corresponding Secretaries and now our own Mrs. Long is State Treas- 
 urer. To the General Organization we have given a Recording Sec- 
 retary General and now have the Registrar General. At this Conven-

 to pleasure of the occasion. A sumptuous dinner was given to the

 feeble thoroughly enjoyed.

 Love." We find subjects for the children and never lose an opportunity 
 to honor the "Days that tried men's souls." America is called the salt 
 of the earth and also continues to be called the "Salt of America."

 flict with our meetings, still the attendance has been marked by a few 
 loyal and faithful ones. Our greatest pleasure this year has been in 
 sending gifts several times during the year to one of our Southern 
 women now residing in the Confederate Home. Her Christmas box 
 contained not only a gift but a cheery greeting from each member of 
 the Chapter. The 10th of May was observed as usual. The older 
 girls assisted in serving lunch to the veterans, and the entire Chapter 
 sang several selections, then marched in a body to the Confederate 
 monument and while "The Stars and Bars" was softly sung a lovely 
 wreath was placed on the base. We stand ever ready to help when 
 needed.

 REMARKS 
 
 The Jane Hughes Chapter was reorganized January 12, 1920, after 
 having been disbanded for a little over two j-ears. Many former 
 members had moved away or reached the age at which they could no 
 longer be called "children" so that when our roll was revised we had ? 1 
 members. Since then our number has increased to 53, but we have 
 accomplished very little otherwise. We, like many other Chapters, were 
 not able to meet in the early spring due to influenza and lost much 
 time, but we are hoping to accomplish much this year.

 REMARKS 
 
 The members of this Chapter, of their own accord, changed its name 
 from "Pittsboro," to "Henry A. London Chapter." This was in memory 
 of Maj. Henry A. London, who went into the war a mere boy and who, 
 as courier to Gen. Bryan Grimes carried the last order on the field 
 at Appomattox, just before the surrender. It was an order to "cease 
 firing." We are doing what good we can, making some money by a 
 rummage sale. And now we are practicing for a little play to come 
 off before Christmas and will, from the proceeds, send contributions to 
 Soldiers' Home, Old Ladies' Home, and to the Old Ladies General 
 Relief Fund. A committee keeps the grass cut around the monument. 
 They sing the "Stars and Bars Forever" and sing other Confederate 
 songs enthusiastically. Mrs. Henry London is going to give us a 
 banner. We have a fine time at our meetings.

 We have been at work on our membership transferring older girls to 
 Mother Chapters. Sent Christmas box to Women's Home also to 
 Soldiers' Home. Gave our Mother Chapter $10.00 on May 10th for 
 dinner for the veterans of Edgecombe County. We have just pur- 
 chased our banner paying $36.46 for it. Of this we are very proud. It 
 is to be carried by our color bearer on all patriotic occasions. In our 
 absence we send by Mrs. John L. Bridgers "The Dixie-Lee Banner." 
 It waves over you all at the Convention with our love and best wishes. 
 Our papers on our veterans are interesting and the children enjoy 
 writing them. A recent one on Mr. Sam Nash Mitten by his little 
 grand-daughter, Annie Gray Johnson, was very much enjoyed. We 
 sing Confederate songs and at present are at work on a play, proceeds 
 to defray our expenses. We have planned to do more work this winter

 We have been studying the Catechism, and have splendid programs — 
 Historical, but not any prescribed course. We sent a nice box of 
 canned goods, jellies and other eatables to the Old Ladies' Home for 
 Thanksgiving, and gave $10.00 to the Nurses' fund. Sent a nice knitted 
 blanket to the hospital at Oteen, and have one ready to send to the Old 
 Ladies' Home. Section A is getting ready for a bazaar, and the chil- 
 dren in Section B are making wash cloths and towels for the Old 
 Ladies' Home. We had the pleasure of entertaining the Fifth District

 These services in memory of our departed Daughters were presided 
 over by Mrs. Thomas W. Wilson, acting Chaplain. 
 
 After the singing of the Doxolog\', there was a moment of silent 
 prayer, followed by an invocation by Rev. Daniel McKinney, Rector of 
 Christ Church. 
 
 After a reading from the Scriptures, the roll of departed members 
 was called. Mrs. T. W. Wilson, acting Chaplain, paid the following 
 tribute : 
 
 "It is quite meet and proper as we convene each year to renew 
 acquaintances and friendships, and to gather new energy and zeal for 
 the good of our organization — that we should pause in the consideration 
 of the program to remember those who are no longer with us. We 
 should keep fresh the memories of our sisters who have gone on before 
 us. This should be a service of retrospection; a tribute enshrined by 
 memorj' — not necessarily mournful, but sympathetic ; a service in which 
 the mind and heart follow the best impulses of human nature in recalling 
 the virtues of those who have passed into a better world. 
 
 "We gather quickened inspiration from these memorial exercises, for, 
 inspiring as are the deeds of the living, yet the quickened memory of 
 the dead is one of the most noble of stimulants to higher ambitions to 
 those who live. We should not grieve only because of the loss of our 
 beloved sisters, but should rather feel a sense of exaltation as we 
 remember and as we are reminded of the many splendid things each did 
 while living to make a better world in which to live — the many things 
 they did to smooth life's pathway for those who remain behind. Some 
 poet has well said : 
 
 "Even for the dead I will not bind my soul to grief, 
 
 Death cannot long divide. 
 For it is not as if the rose had climbed my garden wall. 
 
 And bloomed on the other side. 
 
 "Since our last meeting some of our most beloved Daughters have been 
 taken from us. The beloved founder of this Society, Mrs. William 
 Parsley, is one whom we will greatly miss. But her life was so filled with 
 wonderful work in the bringing together of the Daughters of the Con- 
 federacy that we will all feel a great sense of pride as we are told 
 of her life, in the knowledge that we have the privilege of carrying 
 on her work — as we will also be exalted as we recall the beautiful lives 
 of our other departed Daughters. Mrs. Henrj' A. London will tell 
 you of the noble life of our founder, Mrs. W. M. Parsley."

 MEMORIAL TO MRS. WILLIAM M. PARSLEY. 
 
 Entered into Paradise on June 11, 1920, Mrs. William M. Parsley, 
 the "Mother" of the Daughters of the Confederacy of North Carolina; 
 the most beloved and honored woman in North Carolina. 
 
 Eliza Hall Nutt, daughter of Louise and Henry Nutt, was born in 
 Wilmington, N. C, August 13, 1842. Her early school days were spent 
 at home, and later she was a pupil of St. Mary's School, Raleigh, N. C. 
 
 Gifted in every way with many accomplishments, she was an unusually 
 remarkable woman. Deeply religious, patriotic, patient, uncomplaining, 
 loyal to her friends, generous, tender to those who needed succor, she 
 was always ready with the helping hand and cheering word. 
 
 On September 2, 1862, she was married to Captain William Murdock 
 Parsley — later Colonel Parsley. He was wounded three times, and had 
 short furloughs to his home while recovering from his wounds. Indeed, 
 three months at one time (while badly wounded) was the longest time 
 the young couple spent together after their marriage. After passing 
 through those last terrible days after leaving Richmond, Colonel Parsley 
 was killed April 6, 1865, leaving a young widow watli two baby girls. 
 Those little girls are now Mrs. T. E. Sprunt and Mrs. Horace Emerson 
 of Wilmington, N. C. 
 
 When the news of his death was received, her family were refugees 
 in Sleepy Hollow, Bladen County, N. C. I quote from his daughter's 
 letter : "All of the family were sitting together watching and waiting 
 as ever with anxious hearts, when old 'Titus,' Grandmother Parsley'3 
 faithful servant, came slowly up the walk, and with lowered head 
 handed Grandmother Nutt a letter. No word was uttered, but all felt 
 the terrible news. My mother rose quickly and walked alone some 
 distance away. There she must have suffered her Gethsemane- -and

 conquered. For, when she came back to the house again, she was quiet 
 in her heart's terrible grief — and thus, she unselfishly took up her life 
 once more." 
 
 Friends, we can imagine the horror and bitterness of it for her. 
 Colonel Parsley had fought bravely, and endured, to within three days 
 of the surrender — and then gave up his life for his country! But his 
 brave wife, with cheerful words but aching heart, had given her gallant 
 husband to the Cause which they both felt was Right, and she could do 
 no more. 
 
 State's Rights, Patriotism and Duty were their watchwords ; and she 
 continued after his death to live up to these principles. She realized that 
 it was her duty to help the worn out and disabled soldiers- -to encour- 
 age those who came from the war disheartened, with no interest in 
 life — to give them comfort and to cheer and help them to begin life 
 anew. And her life was a benediction to many a man, for she fully 
 understood the incomparable privations of a Southern soldier's life. 
 
 Mrs. Parsley was an independent little woman, and knowing that there 
 were many worse off than herself, she asked her father to help them. 
 And she accepted a position in a private school where she began the 
 education of her little girls. Her friends have told me that it affected 
 them to tears to see her pass their homes with the hand of each tiny 
 daughter clinging to her own, as the three went to and from school. 
 
 In December, 1894, Mrs. Parsley organized the Cape Fear Chapter of 
 Daughters of the Confederacy, being its first President and continuing 
 at its head for twelve years, until she resigned on account of poor 
 health. In April, 1895, she organized the North Carolina Division of the 
 United Daughters of the Confederacy and was unanimously elected Its 
 first President. It was thus that she became our "Mother," as well as 
 Organizer. Chapters and individual members went to her for guidance 
 and information, and she was more than happy to give correct Confed- 
 erate history to start the new Chapters off straight. She organized the 
 Winnie Davis Chapter in 1898 and I have some of her letters still. 
 
 Mrs. Parsley wanted to "keep history straight," and, as all historians 
 do, she laid stress on the fact that war was practically forced on the 
 South. Commercial jealousy, sectional misunderstandings and the infa- 
 mous tariff of 1828 were the chief causes of the war. Besides this, the 
 South had no thought of war when the first States seceded. They 
 intended to merely pull out, or secede, as was done, or threatened, five 
 different times before 1861 by the New England States. Those New 
 England States were persuaded to come back — but when some of the 
 Southern States seceded, they were not persuaded to come back, but 
 troops were sent to whip them back by an extreme Republican President. 
 This act consolidated the South and brought on the war. Mrs. Parsley 
 urged the Chapters to study the history of the Goevrnment from its 
 very foundation, so that we could give our authorities for our claims —

 and that we must do this in order to teach the young generation corr^'ct 
 history — that the Southern soldiers were heroes and not traitors. 
 
 She loved her Daughters, and appreciated beyond words the beau- 
 tiful pin given her by the Division. She would often look at this and 
 show it while on her sick bed. She was literally a "Mother" of the 
 Confederacy — for she had loved and suffered and lost. Presiding over 
 her Chapter and the Division with a beautiful dignity, she compelled 
 attention by her own intense interest and personality. While speaking 
 for every Daughter in the Division in this brief sketch, I feel that I 
 felt it a privilege to know her and to love her. 
 
 Her two daughters think that everything she did for the Confed- 
 erate veterans and the U. D. C. was done in memory of their father. 
 For she clung tenaciously to her memories of him as boy, lover, brilliant 
 young husband and soldier. What a beautiful thought! He lived 
 through the good works he did for the cause they both loved. 
 
 She always spoke of him as her "young soldier hero husband," and 
 when they looked at her lying so peacefully, they felt that the joyous 
 meeting with "young soldier hero husband" had come ; and that they 
 two were "more than conquerors." 
 
 On All Saints day, when we are remembering "the Saints who from 
 their labors rest," let us think of our dear "Mother" of the Confed- 
 eracy who rests with her Soldier in Paradise. 
 
 Mrs. Henry A. London. 
 
 FRANCES C. FISHER TIERNAN 
 
 Frances C. Fisher Tiernan (Christian Reid), who passed from this 
 world in the spring of 1920, was for more than twenty years a 
 devoted member of the Robert F. Hoke Chapter, United Daughters 
 of the Confederacy, and this Chapter feels that, in her death, the State 
 of North Carolina and the South at large sustains an irreparable loss, 
 a loss beyond our power to estimate or express, and we wish to place 
 on record a memorial of the love and admiration in which this Chapter 
 held — and will forever hold — her fair name, especially for her great 
 contributions to our Chapter and to the Southern cause. She placed 
 the gifts of her mind, her heart, and her pen at the service of this 
 Chapter, finally flowering into that beautiful and stirring war drama, 
 "Under the Southern Cross," which was later acted before scores of 
 Southern audiences, resulting in the creation of many enduring monu- 
 ments, in bronze and stone, to the memory of that superb and wellnigh 
 faultless army of the Confederacy that remains to this day the wonder 
 and admiration of the world. 
 
 We have not only a knowledge of our debt to her, but we have also 
 a true understanding of the debt the State of North Carolina owes to 
 her. Through that exquisite idyll, "The Land of the Sky," she unfolded

 to the gaze of America, and the world beyond our borders, the glories 
 of our Heaven-kissed hills. It is not too much to say that she, more 
 than any other one person born of our State, through her genius for 
 expression, brought unnumbered thousands to our dear country and 
 laid the foundation for much of our present day prosperity. 
 
 As a descriptive writer, none surpassed her. As a novelist, she 
 leads all other North Carolinians. Since the early 70's, when she sprang 
 into immediate fame, to the present day, the State has produced no 
 novelist comparable to her. A number of her novels, notably the "Pic- 
 ture of Las Cruces," have been translated into several foreign languages 
 and have received high praise from the greatest French critics. 
 
 We hold in especial admiration the true and perfect picture she drew 
 of the old South — its charm, its refinement, its nobility. 
 
 She was also a lyric poet of beauty and depth of feeling. 
 
 Her love of the South was a passion, taking the place next to her 
 religion, but when the world war came, her soul flamed with patriotic 
 fire, and though frail in body, she gave of her unquenchable spirit to 
 further the cause of America and the Allies. 
 
 Her private life was so beautiful that those who knew her and loved 
 her will ever regard her as a type of all that was highest in Southern 
 womanhood. She was of a rare and exquisite beauty, with a distinction 
 seldom equalled and a voice like sweetest music. She was deeply reli- 
 gious and gave to her church and her God all that was best in a noble 
 nature. She came of a distinguished ancestry, her father being the 
 gallant Col. Charles F. Fisher, who gave his life for his country at the 
 first battle of Manassas. He is famous as the commander of the 
 Sixth North Carolina regiment, which saved the day at that battle and 
 turned the tide for the Confederacy. 
 
 The State Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy, loved to 
 honor her. She was their first historian and, in 1899, was made Hon- 
 orary President for life. 
 
 She has now passed into that blessed home beyond the grave. "May 
 light perpetual shine upon her."

 Robert Henry Ricks, late commander of the Third North Carolina 
 Brigade, U. C. V., died February 19, 1920, at his country home in Nash 
 County, near the place of his birth. Born April 4, 1839, of honest, 
 patriotic parents, the oldest of four sons and two daughters, his envi- 
 ronment from childhood to manhood was within the modest home on 
 the little farm, away from social and educational advantages. At the 
 age of twenty his father released to him his time, and he engaged with

 a neighbor farmer to work a year. He saved all his salary except 
 twenty dollars and loaned it out, thus early demonstrating his capacity to 
 save money, a virtue that generally indicates success in life. 
 
 When the storm, long threatening, between the North and the South 
 burst forth in April, 1861, young Ricks promptly volunteered in the 
 Edgecombe Guards, Bethel regiment. He was in the battle of Bethel 
 June 10, 1861, and upon a call for volunteers, was one of the six who 
 made the dash wherein Henry Wyatt lost his life. Upon the disband- 
 ment of the Bethel Regiment in November, 1861, its term of enlistment 
 having expired, he joined Lloyd's Battery, then about to go out from 
 Edgecombe County into the service, and a few months later, when 
 the three batteries of Manly, Reilly and Lloyd were consolidated into 
 two, retaining the names of Manly and Reilly, he found himself in 
 Manly's Batterj-^ in the Army of Northern Virginia. Brave and every 
 day ready for duty, he served as a private in the Confederate Army 
 from Bethel to Appomattox; and came out unscathed, as did two 
 brothers and his father, then an old man. 
 
 On his return home he took up the work he left four years before — 
 the slaves now freed and conditions greatly changed — at the salary of 
 one hundred and fifty dollars a year, which job he held 'till 1874, when 
 his employer, (a bachelor) died, leaving him a legacy worth perhaps a 
 thousand dollars. 
 
 During the decade thus ending he had frequently spent his Sunday 
 evenings with Miss Tempie Thorne, who owned and operated an 
 adjoining farm. And now at the age of thirty-five, he was confronted 
 with two crises in his life : One was that he was hopelessly in love ; 
 the other that his early and steadfast vision to lift himself and his 
 family above the routine of their past was promising realization. So he 
 determined to cast his future in Texas, and was making preparations to 
 do so, when friends intervened and he remained in North Carolina, and 
 December, 1874, married Miss Tempie. 
 
 This acquisition of a sound, sensible wife, devoted to home and appre- 
 ciating its value — she, the mistress indoors, and he the master afield — 
 completed his thorough equipment for the succeeding forty-five years of 
 their lives, he at once a practical farmer, a money maker and saver, and 
 success naturally followed. Temperate in all things, plain in dress and 
 manner, active in democratic policies and politics, approachable, taking 
 time for the social and harmless recreations, aggressive against society's 
 habits of waste and extravagance, shop drinking and cigarette smoking, 
 he became a leader among men. 
 
 He erected a fifteen thousand dollar monument to his county com- 
 rades, and gave twenty-five thousand dollars to have a correct war 
 history of his State written. He also gave ten thousand dollars towards 
 a Masonic Temple. He was a continual helper with money for the 
 betterment of his kindred and others always ready to help those who

 wanted to get an education and would take advantage of his help, but 
 he was not much on helping anyone who would not help himself. 
 Through his aid many girls and boys were able to get the foundation 
 upon which their lives were built. 
 
 Besides acting as trustee for many big institutions, General Ricks 
 served the public in office from constable to State Senator, and partici- 
 pated as an officer or director in various industrial plans in which he 
 had invested. It was as a rich man General Ricks was most prominent; 
 for, without gambling, just in a plain everyday business way, he amassed 
 a large amount of money, leaving an estate conservatively estimated at 
 one and a half million dollars, nearly all of which was invested around 
 his home and which has materially contributed to making Rocky Mount 
 one of the best towns in the State. This vast amount he distributed 
 by a will in such a way as to aid many relatives and friends and looking 
 to the future he provided so that his relatives could all have an educa- 
 tion for generations. 
 
 General Ricks was always the friend of the U. D. C. and whenever 
 he was approached for help for any Confederate cause his left hand 
 never knew what his right hand was doing but the cause was always 
 benefitted.
