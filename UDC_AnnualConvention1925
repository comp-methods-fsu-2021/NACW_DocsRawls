32 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Address of welcome in behalf of the Aikansas Division,
United Daughters of the Confederacy,—Mrs. Lora Gaines
Goolsby, President.
Madam President-General, Confederate Veterans, Sons of Veterans,
Daughters of the Confederacy, and Visitors:
As the representative of the Arkansas Division of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy, it is my happy privilege to wel-
come you to Arkansas, "The Wonder State" and "the land of a
million smiles." We are indeed glad to have you as our guests,
and if it is within our power, we are going to make you glad
also.
We are proud of our State in many ways. We are perhaps a
little boastful when we recall that it was an Arkansas writer, a
very young man, who had his poems accepted and published in
the Blackwood Magazine, long before any of the famous New
England group attained to such honors; that the greatest Indian
Council in history was held upon her soil; that within her borders
there lived for three years a President of the United States, and
that it was in Arkansas that our own Jefferson Davis, wooed and
won his bride,—the daughter of a President. We take great
pride in the fact that while our fathers loved peace, they hesi-
tated not when the call "to arms," in the sixties, but marched
forth valiantly in defense of our Southland. We recall with
just pride the leaders that Arkansas gave to the Confederacy,—
Churchill, Holmes, Fagan, Hindman, Pike, Pierce, Cabell, Shaver,
and the gallant Pat Cleburne. Arkansas has one town which has
the distinction of having been the home of seven Confederate
Generals. We thrill with patriotic pride when we remember
that it was Arkansas that gave to the world its youngest martyr,
in the person of little David Owen Dodd, who went to his death
on the gallows rather than betray another, and that one in the
ranks of the enemy. Proud are we of the heroic fight against
an adverse fate, that was put up by our fathers and mothers in
the years that succeeded the cruel sixties.
In the short duration of the Spanish-American War, Arkansas
did her part nobly. In the World War she led in many patriotic
drives, and in citations for heroism, stood in the front rank.
We are proud of the fact that our soil produces every variety
of food, every staple for clothing, every mineral and drug necessary
to the health, comfort and happiness of her people. Yes, she
does even more, for from her rivers and mountains come offerings
of the rarest of jewels for her children.
But there is one thing in which we take far greater pride than
all these,—and that is, her spirit of hospitality. You have, of
course, heard those old stories told on Arkansas by penny-a-liners,
in which her people were accused of every sin in the category.
Did I say every one? No, there was one, of which even the
most brilliant of these writers did not charge them, and that was
the sin of inhospitality. When the Catholic fathers travelled down
the Mississippi river on their missionary journeys, they were met
at almost every landing place with hatred and hostility. At one

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 33
point only were they sure of a generous welcome. At one place
only came the natives bringing gifts from their stores of venison,
nuts and maize. These people were the Arkansas Indians, and the
place was our own State, named for this gentle, lovable tribe.
Providence seems to have ordained that this should remain the
land of hospitality, for the white settlers, who a few years later
sought homes within her confines, were generous and whole-
hearted, ever ready to extend the hand of friendship to the stranger
within the gates.
You have doubtless heard the story of the Arkansas Traveler
and his conversation with the squatter. You have perhaps laughed
and thought only of one side of that old tale; that of the house
that leaked only when it rained, and couldn't be mended when
it was raining. Now you re-read that old narrative and get a
deeper meaning. Somehow, I have always admired that old
squatter, because of the fact that so long as the traveller asked
impertinent questions, he received exactly the answers that he
deserved. But note this fact: Just as soon as the traveller showed
himself human, took up the old fiddle, and played the part that
had eluded the squatter, that old fellow rushed forward, grasped
the traveller's hand, bade him welcome to the dry corner of the
cabin, invited him to sit on the best stool, had the biggest rooster
killed, told "Mam" to put the "big pot in the little one," and when
at last Pap and Ma, Granny, Bud, Sal, and all the rest of the nu-
merous family had gathered 'round the festive board, the old
squatter bade the stranger take choice of the family plate, which
consisted of "Big Butch," "Little Butch," "Cob-handle" and "Gran-
ny's knife."
Now, Daughters of the Confederacy, again let me assure you
that we are glad, thrice glad, to have you with us, and for the
Arkansas Division, I extend to you the same welcome given by
our Arkansas Indians to the good fathers,—all that we possess is
yours, come in ,and enjoy it. We want you to know that if you
find a house where the latch string does not hang outside the
door, the owner of that house is not a native.
We open our homes and our hearts to you, and in the words
of our far-famed squatter ancestor, bid you "Come right in,
stranger, take the dry corner, sit on the best stool, we'll kill the
biggest rooster, put the big pot in the little one, and when we
sit down together at the table, take your choice of "Big Birtch,"
"Little Butch," "Cob-handle" or "Granny's knife."
Address of welcome in behalf of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy, of Hot Springs, Mrs. W. E. Massey, as
follows:
Madam President-General and Members of the Thirty-second An-
nual Convention, United Daughters of the Confederacy:
It is my very great pleasure and privilege to bring you greetings
and a hearty welcome from the Hot Springs Chapter, United
Daughters of the Confederacy, the biggest little Chapter in all the
world. From each of our 32 loyal and faithful members, as one

34 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
heart beat true, comes a loving wish that your meeting in our city
will be the pleasantest, the most harmonious and the most con-
structive, that you have ever held.
I, Madam President-General, find it very difficult to express my
personal feelings.
To have been chosen to bespeak the welcome from my Chapter,
fills me with a sense of my unworthiness, to deliver that welcome
officially to you, my friends, on the opening night of the closing
session of your administration fills me with sadness. This is our
accolade. Your efforts have been crowned with success, our high-
est joy has been obtained, from this hour there is no greater thing
in the United Daughters of the Confederacy circles, for either of
us.
It has been 27 years since the General United Daughters of the
Confederacy honored Hot Springs with its presence. The memory
of that meeting with its distinguished hostess, Mrs. J. M. Keller,
and its very charming presiding officer, Mrs. Katie Cabel Muse of
Texas, lingers in our hearts like a rich perfume. It was at this
meeting 27 years ago that one of our own Arkansas Daughters, the
founder of our Division, Mrs. C. A. Forney-Smith, served as First
Vice-President. From that time to this, Arkansas Daughters have
rendered valuable, faithful and efficient service, to the general
organization as officers, chairmen of Committees, or members who
have sat in council and formed a part of the most distinguished,
the most patriotic and the most one hundred per cent American
organization in the whole world, the United Daughters of the
Confederacy.
The spirit of our founders has never departed from our camp
and their exemplary ideals go ever before us as a pillar of cloud
by day and a pillar of fire by night, leading us in the ways of
progress, the paths of purpose, and making us to sit down beside
the still waters of fellowship and love.
For five years the Hot Springs Chapter has sent official invita-
tions to the General Convention United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy to meet in Hot Springs. As newly elected president of the Ar-
kansas Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy, and a mem-
ber of the local Chapter, I went to Asheville, N. C., to deliver that
invitation. St. Louis, Mo., through the invitation of Mrs. J. P. Hig-
gins, went off with the 1921 Convention, unabashed, we tried
again. Mrs. Cory took the 1922 Convention to Birmingham. Brave
souls we, who fared forth a third time. Washington City got that
prize, and 1924 saw the aristocratic old city of Savannah take the
palm. Then like young Lochinvar, we just mounted a metaphoric
Charger and rode out of the west and took the 1925 Convention
highhanded. Here we are, Whatever we said to get it we do not
know, we do not remember, but one thing sure, we will redeem
our promises.
Anticipation is said to be sweeter, always, than realization. The
anticipation of this very hour has been the inspiration for our
committees during the past year and as we came together each
Wednesday morning for the past eight weeks, making our plans
and reporting our work, we visualized this very scene. I wish
that you too, could have "listened in" at those meetings, and have


## p. 35 (#39) ##############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 35
heard all that we said and did, all that we hoped, all that we have
dreamed, and when our committees grew larger and the whole of
Arkansas joined in to plan for your comfort and happiness, I
doubly wish that each of you could have caught the wonderful
spirit of harmony and cooperation that has made ttie preparations
for this meeting a labor of love, that brings a tinge of regret that
after this week those weekly meetings are ended.
You have come tonight to hold your 32nd Annual Convention in
the land full of song and story, the land of the Indian, the Span*-
iard, the French, the Pioneer, the Confederate soldier, and the
men of the World War. The land the Indian said was touched by
the Great White Spirit, the land of De Soto, Ponce de Leon, Henri
de Tonti, General Boniville and Albert Pike. The land of Yell and
Cleburne, the land of Admiral Eberle and Field. Kindly, one of
the seven American aces. We are not only proud of our historic
and noble background, our forefathers, who cut a path in the wil-
derness, and founded and established this city between two hills,
but we are proud, also, of our present, our men and women of af-
fairs, of Arkansas, today as she moves majestically in natural or-
der well up toward the front of the distinguished procession of
states.
We would remind you that Hot Springs was the first national
park created in the United States of America. While all the other
national parks now owned by our Uncle Sam were yet barren
waste, known only to the wild things of earth, our own city was
known and recognized as a great national asset and became offi-
cially, in 1832, a national playground, a nation's sanitorium, a boon
to suffering and tired humanity. From that day to this, Hot
Springs has never taken one backward step, golf courses have
taken the place of the Indian Trails, modern hotels have succeeded
the hut of the pioneer, marble baths have evolved from the rough
rock basin of the Spanish explorer, and health and happiness ra-
diate from the faces of those who have been healed in body and
spirit, here in God's great out of doors.
It is a pretty legend that where the ancient Greeks discovered a
spring flowing from the ground, that there they erected an altar
to some favorite god. It is a far cry from the ancient Greeks to
this 17th day of November, 1925, but it is a pretty fancy of my own
that here upon the green slope of the East mountain, over the heal-
ing springs, there is an altar that cannot be seen by mortal eyes.
It is an altar to the living God, upon it the thanks of a grateful
people are daily laid and sweet incense, like a vapor, is perpet-
ually rising in praise of our Heavenly Father, who remembered
us and places them there.
Madam President, this week you bring to us much that is won-
derfully fine in inspiration, and information, vou will tell us of
the time you have spent for us in various positions of trust, and
we will listen with enthusiasm to the record as told in your re-
ports. In return we will give you from the City of Hot Springs,
the State or Arkansas and the local Chapter, which I have the hon-
or to represent, the best we have in loving service and abundant
hospitality.

36 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Response to addresses of welcome for the United
Daughters of the Confederacy,—Mrs. Walter Lamar,
Macon, Georgia.
Vocal Solo—Miss John Wootton; Accompanist, Prof.
Arthur Platz.
Miss Decca Lamar West, of Texas, presented the Presi-
dent-General, Mrs. Frank Harrold, of Americus, Georgia.
We have a pleasant little fiction of "introducing" our most im-
portant members each year. It is true they are sometimes in-
troduced by people equally important, but it does seem rather
presumptious in a high private to be presenting the commander-
in-chief of the army, doesn't it? Still orders are orders and it
is up to the private to obey. When my superior, the Adjutant-
General of the Program Committee, Mrs. Lamar summoned me,
I, feeling highly honored, responded promptly "yes." Had she
informed me that she was to precede me, vanity would have
prompted a different response.
Now when I speak of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
as an "army," please do not think we are fighters, for we are
not, at least not often! We do boast of being an army of workers
and on every occasion _ of this kind we can but wish there was
more time to tell our listeners of the REAL work.
We are not organized to keep alive strife and bitterness as
many still seem to think. Most of us were born since the bitter-
ness has past, but "love makes memory eternal," and it is our
duty to see that justice is done, and homage paid to the great
men and women who sacrificed all for principle. To demand
that the truth of history shall be taught, is to blot out the fallacy
that the institution of slavery was the cause of the War Between
the States, and to establish the fact that the principles for which
our fathers fought, "the right of the State to Self-Government,"
were precisely the same as the principle involved in every Ameri>-
can War and demonstrated to the world in the great war of 1917.
The right of the small nation to Self-Determination, the phrase
coined, and the plan inaugurated and promulgated by the great
American Woodrow Wilson, was based on the same eternal prin-
ciple of human justice that inspired the hearts of the South in
1861, under the leadership of another matchless statesman—Jeffer-
son Davis!
Were there time, one could draw a splendid parallel between
the long line of distinguished men of Georgia, in their service to
the United States and to the Confederate States of America, and
of her equally distinguished Daughters who give their service
freely to this organization.
Georgia initiative.—Georgia from the time of the great liberator
Oglethorpe to the present day. Georgia courage—Georgia brains—
Georgia energy—exemplified in her citizenry, from the American
Revolution to the Worlds greatest War.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 37
In the light of recent events we can study with clear minds the
epoch of the Confederacy. While the whole South was marvelous
in its growth and development after its four years of horror and
devastation, no people in the South ever showed greater courage
and heroism than the people of Georgia who with their sister
State, South Carolina, literally, "rose from their ashes," as truly
as the. fated Phoenix.
To say that the leaders of Georgia today measure up to the
standards of Alexander Stevens, Robert Tombs, John B. Gordan,
of the Howells, of the Cobbs, the Lamars, the Milledges, the
Knights, the Blounts, the Laniers, the Colquitts, the Rufherfords,
the Greshams, and a thousand and one names that time has re-
corded, is high praise indeed, but true.
We recall that Georgia gave to America two orators, world fa-
mous, "Silver tongue Ben Hill," of the old regime, whose match-
less eulogy on General Lee is a classic^—and that herald of the
New South and a reunited country, Henry W. Grady, of whom it
is said, "he loved a nation into peace."
Many times have we chosen Georgia women for our leaders
since they first were pioneers in this organization. Georgia, with
her usual insight had picked and trained them as State leaders,
graciously she yielded them to the wider service. Mrs. Helen
Plane, Mrs. Raines, Mrs. Thomas, Mrs. Rounsaville, Mrs. Walter
Lamar, Miss Rutherford, and a host of others have proven true to
Georgia traditions, for brilliance, eloquence and leadership.
Georgia's latest contribution to the good of the whole cause has
been the service of our own Mrs. Frank Harrold, for six arduous
years. Four years as President of the Georgia Division—two
years as first Vice-President of General Organization, her ability
was recognized two years ago by her election as President-General.
Into all the ramifications of this intricate work, she has gone
with the intelligence, dignity, and poise that were expected! Could
one say more? With all the multifarious duties faithfully per-
formed, she has always had time for those courtesies and kind-
nesses that enshrine her in our hearts as a friend, and endear
her to every Veteran.
In Georgia it is true she may be known as the sister of the
Governor, but in our ranks the Governor of Georgia has the dis-
tinguished honor of being the brother of our President-General—
the highest honor that can come to a Southern woman. Most of
the South despite the fact we appreciate and recognize our du-
ties of citizenship, still cling to the old ideals and we love to
liken our woman's work to that of the weaver. Our President}-
General typifies the Daughters of the Confederacy, of whom we
think as the Spinner in the Sun, weaving a beautiful tapestry!
Long ago she strung her warp of silver with strong threads of
faith, love, perseverance and service. Now she is weaving with
the golden threads of purpose, of knowledge, of power. Deftly
in the design are scattered beautiful flowers, roses, lilies, and
violets, the roses are splendid deeds of noble achievement, flowers
that flaunt themselves in the sun. They are all about, giving
warmth and brightness—color. The lilies are the hundred and
one things that were done faithfully; but the violets—O, they
are dim and shadowy, but they give that wonderful softness to

the whole wieb. What are they? They are the help to the friend-
less, the kindness to the distressed, the word of encouragement to
the disheartened; always they were given in secret but there are
thousands of them, and it seems to me I can smell their fragrance,
and can see them move, for into them are woven her heart-throbs.
O, Spinner in the Sun, keep on with your weaving and when your
work is finished, may it be like the splendid tapestries of old.
The world will come to behold and study the picture—your epoch
in history 1
The President-General responded in a short but elo-
quent address.
Greetings were extended by General W. B. Freeman,
Commander-in-Chief, United Confederate Veterans; Dr.
W. C. Galloway, Commander-in-Chief, Sons of Confed-
erate Veterans; Mrs. Harry Anderson, for the Arkansas
Society, D. A. R.; Major Howell Brewer, Official Orator,
American Legion; Mrs. Samuel Preston Davis, President
National Society United States Daughters of 1812.

Mrs. John L. Woodbury, of Kentucky, presented Mrs.
Charles Bryan, of Tennessee, an Honorary President,
who expressed her pleasure in being present.
Mrs. W. E. R. Byrne, of West Virginia, presented the
Past-Presidents-General, Mrs. Katie Cabell Currie Muse,
Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, Miss Mary Poppenheim,
Mrs. Roy Weaks McKinney and Mrs. Livingston Rowe
Schuyler.
The Past Presidents-General addressed the Convention,
expressing their appreciation of the welcome extended
and their gratification at the growth of the organization.
Vocal Solo—Mrs. James Colburn Miller.
Mrs. Edwin Goffigon, of Cape Charles, Virginia, Chair-
man of Pages, presented the Pages.
Benediction—Rev. C. E. Hickok.

splendid work rendered during her term of office.
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT-GENERAL
To the United Daughters of the Confederacy in Convention As-
sembled:
Upon our gathering here today, thoughts of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy in all sections and in every State of this great
country are centered. Though the great majority of our sisters
cannot be with us and vast distances may separate us in body,
we are as always, united in the spirit of patriotism and loyalty.
We feel the same love and devotion to our ideals and are
forever united in the one purpose to serve faithfully and
unselfishly our country and our splendid organization to the end.
Hot Springs, our hostess city, enjoys nation-wide popularity.
Her hospitality, her climate and her citizenry are by-words of
praise. The reputation of Hot Springs has extended to all our
homes and stimulated anticipation of delight in the honor of being
received here as guests.
For the United Daughters of the Confederacy, though, there is
a very special interest in Hot Springs and the State of Arkansas.
We count it an unusual and rich privilege to spend our Convention
hours amid the home scenes of Churchill, Hindman, Cleborne,
Clourney and all their enthusiastic fellow Arkansas workers in
the cause we cherish and hold so dear.
It is two years since your President-General stood, in all hu-
mility, before the delegates at the Washington Convention and
accepted the presidency of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy. The immensity of the task which had been placed be-
fore her was for the moment overwhelming. But at once into
her consciousness came the realization that from all over this
country there was flowing a vast surge of love and friendship
from the 100,000 Daughters who stood ever ready for loyal service.
In this assurance she accepted the office and confidently relying
upon a Strength greater than her own she cheerfully assumed
the leadership you offered. With all her zeal and with all her
strength she has labored but the burdens have been lighter, the
problems simpler and the joy more satisfying because of the en-
thusiastic and sympathetic interest manifested by our entire mem-
bership.


## p. 53 (#57) ##############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 53
This beautiful spirit of fellowship was expressed with even
greater sincerity when in her own bereavement the President-
General was the recipient of many messages of love and condolence
from members, Chapters and Divisions of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy in every section of the country. For these expres-
sions of friendship and these tokens of true sympathy she wishes
again to convey her heartfelt thanks and deepest appreciation.
Because of your constant efforts, your splendid co-operation
and loyal enthusiasm during the past years the United Daughters
of the Confederacy has advanced to the forefront of patriotic
societies in America. Your President-General, therefore, feels., an
intense pride and pleasure in submitting the following report of
our work and achievements.
Bereavements
Before entering upon the detailed resume of the year's activities,
let us pause a moment, with sorrow and sympathy to note the
death of some of our most valued members. Deeply do we
mourn the passing of a beloved Past President-General and Hon-
orary President, Mrs. Cornelia Branch Stone, who, on January
18, 1925, in her 84th year, laid down the cares and responsibili-
ties of a noble and useful life which had been enriched by ser-
vice to her family, her nation and her Creator.
We regret to announce the death of three Honorary Presidents
—Mrs. C. Helen Plane, Mrs. Electra Semmes Colston and Mrs. Wil-
liam Hume.
Others who have been summoned by the Grim Reaper are Mrs.
F. G. Sutherlin, past President of the Washington Division; Mrs.
Mary Terry Burnett, of Kentucky; Mrs. Charles Collier Harvey,
mother of our Treasurer-General; Mrs. Thomas Wilson, former
President of the North Carolina Division; Mrs. Jacksie Daniel
Thrash Morrison former President of the North Carolina Division.
During the year just closed the United Confederate Veterans,
also, have lost by death the distinguished services of Colonel
Malcom Crump; Captain William T. Ellis; General Thomas D.
Osborne; General C. A. Reed; Lieutenant-General James M. Coch-
ran; Major-General J. B. Stone; Brigadier-General J. F. Shipp;
Brigadier)-General J. H. Nave; Major-General James McKay;
Brigadier-General T. C. Holland; Brigadier-General W. C. Harrel-
son; General T. W. Twiggs.
Relief
The first object of the United Daughters of the Confederacy is
to honor the memory of those who served and those who fell in
promoting and upholding the cause of the Confederate States.
There is no need to recount their deeds; no need to call to mind
the heroism of the men and women who bore aloft the banner of
our glorious inheritance; no purpose in telling anew the tales of
privation and suffering which they endured. It is sufficient to
remember that the Confederate soldiers and the brave women
left at home unanimously answered the call of the South, ready
and willing to make the supreme sacrifice for home and honor.

54 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
"They gave us great glory, what more could they give?
They left us a story, a story to live!"
Today, the fast thinning ranks of the Confederate Veterans
remind us that the burden of our responsibility to those who re-
main is greater than ever before. Confederate relief work calls
us with more urgency. It cannot be postponed. It must be done
today. The men and women of the Confederacy who need aid
need it NOW.
That our organization is awakening to the importance of this
relief call is clearly shown in the liberal response which has been
made to the appeals of the chairman for the Mrs. Norman V. Ran-
dolph Fund for Needy Confederate Women. This fund grows
each year, yet the demands upon it increase in a greater propor-
tion. At present, 27 of these old ladies, most of them in localities
where there are no chapters of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy and where no pension is paid them, are receiving $15.00
each a month from this source. This means an annual expendi-
ture of $4,680.00. The signing of these monthly checks gives
your President-General greater personal satisfaction than almost
any other of her official duties. (Applause).
To insure the continuance of this fund, the Savannah Conven-
tion last year asked that the voluntary subscriptions be increased
to $5.00 per chapter. At this Convention suggestions will be ref-
ceived for the creation of a permanent fund for these needy
women. Mrs. J. P. Higgins the Treasurer^General, has offered a
prize of $25.00 for the best plan submitted.
The Confederate Veteran
The Confederate Veteran is our official publication. Monthly
it carries to our members the news of our activities. It is dedi-
cated to the high principles which the Southern patriotic societies
uphold; and it deserves the loyal support of all Daughters.
Your President-General has sent a message through the col-
umns of each issue of the Confederate Veteran. She has been
especially mindful that this has given her an opportunity to
broadcast to the members the outstanding facts concerning the
progress of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. It has been
an effective means of securing closer co-operation between the
General Organization, the Divisions and the Chapters. Your
Hj,storian-General also offers instructive monthly programs
through the, Veteran.
No chapter can afford to be without the help of this magazine.
Division Presidents should urge Chapter Presidents to use ma-
terial from the department of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy at each meeting, and in this way, members may be in-
formed concerning all important subjects relating to our work.
At the last Convention a resolution was adopted, authorizing
the President-General to appoint a committee to solicit subscrip-
tions for the Veteran. This resolution provided that the Editor
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy Department of the
Veteran be chairman, with a director from each Division and
from each Chapter where there is no Division. All funds for
subscriptions to be sent through the Treasurer-General.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 55
The chairman, Mrs. R. D. Wright, Newberry S. C., states that
practically all directors reported gains both in numbers of sug-
scriptions and in interest and that the co-operation of Division
Directors has been most helpful and gratifying.
Mrs. Wright as editor of the department devoted to the United
Daughters of the Confederacy, has been giving her best efforts
to this work, which is but in line with her unvarying response
to every call made upon her by the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy.
Once more the President-General desires to thank both the Con-
federate Veteran and Miss Edith Pope, the editor, for the liberal
space, uniform courtesy, encouragement and constant stimulus
for greater effort which has been extended to her throughout her
administration.
Children of the Confederacy
The Children of the Confederacy constitutes the splendid auxil-
iary to our work. It performs a notable service in training our
children along the lines of true patriotism. With a view to the
future of our own organization we cannot think too seriously of
this junior branch. Only by properly directing our children—
the women of tomorrow—can we hope to see the burdens and
responsibilities intelligently assumed. They must be ready when
the passage of time forces us to relinquish them ourselves.
The covenant of the past is entrusted to us in memoriam. It
is ours to keep in safety. It is ours to pass on with added honors
to a posterity who will render a greater service and share a fuller
glory.
The President-General feels strongly that it is now time to make
a concerted effort to organize a Chapter of the Children of the
Confederacy in each Chapter of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy. In this way our boys and girls will contact the basic
principles of genuine patriotism. Thus they will learn true states-
manship and constructive leadership.
It is of the greatest importance that the young people should
know the traditions, history and ideals of the Old South. By in-
stilling in them love and reverence for the Stars and Bars, a flag
which is furled forever and laid away with tears, we show them
to what heights love of country may raise a people. By teaching
them to honor and respect our Confederate Veterans, living and
dead, we impress upon them what devotion to a flag and principle
may mean. In short, we prepare them to defend and uphold the
Flag and Constitution of our reunited country.
The work of the Children of the Confederacy, under Mrs. Charles
Wallace. Third Vice-President-General, indicates constructive and
energetic service. Showing the splendid work which is being
done in this department, fifty-seven (57) new chapters were char-
tered and 2957 new members were added during 1925, making a
. total registration of 14960.
Registration
The rapid growth in our members during the past year has com-
pelled tremendous activity in the office of the Registrar-General.

She has given invaluable and untiring service. Moreover, she has
produced results of which we should be justly proud.
The necessity of providing more assistance for this officer calls
for action at this Convention. We are a business corporation.
We should have up-to-date business methods. It is important
that proper steel files should be furnished the Registrar-General
and that a card index be introduced. The volume of valuable
records constantly increases. Thousands of membership papers
have to be handled. Further, it is almost impossible for the
Registrar-General to record the work of 24 Division Registrars
and 14 Chapter Registrars where there are no Divisions.
We have no fire-proof building in which to store these im-
portant records, but suitable protection should be provided for
them. Our Registrar-General should be relieved of unnecessary
detailed work by the use of files and a card index system. It is,
therefore, recommended that authority be given the Registrar-
General to purchase steel files and that the necessary funds be
appropriated from the General Treasury, subject to the approval
of the Finance Committee.
During 1925, a total of 8000 members were registered. Mrs.
Woodliff will tell in her report of changes made in the membeiy
ship application blanks, all of which have the approval of the
President-General.
Certificates
In the two years of this administration, your President-General's
name has been signed to 27,000 certificates of membership in the
United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Children of the Con-
federacy and to Cross of Service certificates. (Applause).
Membership
The membership of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
now exceeds 100,000. While our stronghold is still, as it should
be, in the South our influence has extended far beyond the con-
fines of the Mason and Dixon line. We have Chapters scattered
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Rio Grande to the
Columbia, from the Gulf to the Great Lakes. Even beyond the
borders of the United States have we grown, for we have a
flourishing Chapter in Paris. We have become truly interna-
tional in scope, and we stand today as one of the most active and
influential of women's organizations in the world.
Each Daughter should make it her individual duty to see that
every woman in her community, eligible for membership, is at
least given the opportunity to file her application papers. There
are still many women who can be benefited by our association.
This gratifying increase in membership should continue, until
every loyal Southern woman, eligible to become a Daughter, is
enrolled.
"If there is strength in numbers, there is more strength in
organized numbers."
As our membership steadily grows, let us guard against the
error of measuring our strength by numbers alone. It is only

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 57
actual accomplishment in service which counts. Our increased
membership is valuable only as it gives greater opporunity to
serve. With membership should come a larger view of the power
for good which our co-ordinated energies may embody. There
should be an understanding of the force inherent in this linking
of the same ideals, north and south, east and west. We should
be aware of the strengthening of every fiber of our organization
through the ever widening range of our membership fabric.
Let us as Daughters remember that only in true union is there
real strength. Let everyone be watchful lest a single link in the
chain which binds us together is severed by lack of unity among
ourselves. Then if differences of opinion arise, the desire for
personal domination and self expression will be properly subordi-
nated to the greater good of the organization—to our Cause and
all that it stands for. The United Daughters of the Confederacy
is the paramount consideration. And at all times one of our
most worthy objects is to "Cherish the ties of friendship among
the members of our Society."
To be worthy of the soldier blood of our fathers, we must be
courageous. We must eliminate strife and internal differences
and stand shoulder to shoulder, inspired by the feeling that the
fate of our campaign for truth and justice, for honor and service,
rests upon us.
"It is of no avail to a woman to be able to point out that her
ancestor was a member of Lee's army, unless she herself is doing
something to exemply the virtues of those heroes. (Applause).
The fact of her proud heritage ennobles not, unless it bears fruit
in spurring her to nobler conduct."
The good name, the greatness, the glory and the honor of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy depend upon the conduct
and character of the individual members. Let our action cast no
shadow upon the loftiness and beautify of our standard of truth.
Thus, not only by our ancestry and our inheritance, but also by
our own lives and efforts, may we hold undisputed title to the
high honor of being a Daughter of the Confederacy. (Applause).
To insure continuity in our activities we must encourage every-
where the organization of Chapters for the young people. The
"Alexander Allen Faris Trophy" goes to the Division sending in
the greatest number of new members between the ages of eighteen
and twenty-five.
Education
If the United Daughters of the Confederacy had no other work
than perpetuating history that in itself would be worthwhile.
Unswervingly, we shall forever keep sacred the memory of our
dead. But at the same time we recognize a specific obligation to
the living and in our educational work we are performing a most
important service in aiding students to finance their advanced
schooling. Indeed, we thereby honor our dead, for every scholar-
ship, loan fund, medal or prize which is offered a student is_ at
the same time a commemoration of some one's love and devotion
to the ideals of the Confederacy.

58 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Fifteen years ago the United Daughters of the Confederacy,
giving tangible substance to its belief in the importance of educa-
tion, appointed a standing committee to direct and finance the
hundreds of scholarships which our Organization bestows annual-
ly upon worthy young people.
Through the various funds which supply these scholarships our
Organization feels that we demonstrate to the world our determi-
nation that there shall be no compromise with ignorance and illit-
eracy in America. The permanent Hero Educational Fund of $50,-
000, which stands as a memorial "To honor the men of the South
who served their re-united country wherever needed in 1917-1918,"
and the Hector W. Church Fund of $12,000 are outstanding ex-
amples. The latter has been divided into four scholarships named
after Confederate leaders, General Robert E. Lee, General John B.
Gordon, General Jubal Early and President Jefferson Davis.
Another important educational work is being accomplished
through the committee for Awarding the University Prize for
Confederate Essays written in northern universities. This has
led students in these institutions to investigate southern topics
formerly unknown to them.
Gift of $10,000
You will recall that at the Washington Convention it was de-
cided to raise an endowment fund of $10,000, to enable our organi-
zation to offer a biennial prize called the "Mrs. Simon Baruch
Prize" of $1,000 to stimulate this research work in southern his-
tory among students of the north. Through the generosity of
Mr. Bernard Baruch the committee is now ready to announce
terms and details for the competition. For this particular fund
Mr. Baruch has made a gift of $10,000 through the Mary Mildred
Sullivan Chapter of New York, as a memorial to his mother, Mrs.
Simon Baruch. (Applause).
On behalf of the United Daughters of the Confederacy the
President-General conveyed to Mr. Baruch an expression of sin-
cere appreciation for this great gift and voiced the hope that he
will ever regard this fund as a most fitting tribute to the memory
of his beloved mother. Mr. Baruch is the son of a surgeon of
the Confederate army who rose to the highest rank in the medical
corps. The President-General recommends that a vote of thanks
from this Convention be sent Mr. Baruch.
Another forward step was taken in our educational work when
the 31st Annual Convention unanimously voted to establish the
Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship (Applause) for law stu-
dents at the University of Virginia. An endowment fund of
$12,000 is to be created for this purpose, of which $6,085 was
pledged at Savannah.
Under further instructions from the Savannah Convention there
was established at Randolpht-Macon Woman's College a fellowship
of $5,000 in honor of the late Mrs. Cornelia Branch Stone of Texas,
Honorary President and former President-General.
The President-General is happy to report a great and growing
interest in these scholarships, and is especially proud to announce


## p. 59 (#63) ##############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 59
that the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship for 1925 has been awarded
to J. Summerfleld Andrews, Roanoke, Virginia, and the Lee Me-
morial Scholarship at Washington and Lee University to Robert
Bryarly Lee, Bel Air, Maryland. (Applause).
Mrs. T. T. Stevens, Chairman of Education, will offer a report
showing progressive work in this field of endeavor.
The historical and educational work of our organization has a
value exceeding three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($350,000.00), made up of annual prizes and scholarships, as well
as an invested fund of more than two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000.00).
President Coolidge says: "The future of the nation depends
upon the development and training of its youth." It is our boys
and girls who are the builders of the new America and it is our
duty to see that the seeds of patriotism are sown in such fertile
soil that their germination is assured. For beyond doubt the hope
of tomorrow rests upon the present, and the coming generation
will be absolutely what we make of it.
In the distribution of the book, "Women of the South in War
Times" Mrs. Edwin Robinson has been serving loyally, faithfully
and effectively, even though, at times, the work seems slow. Under
her guidance the assignment has now passed the half-way mark,
and it remains for some of the States with large quotas to formu-
late a plan within their respective Divisions which will enable
them to do that which has been done by those Divisions that have
completed their full quota, the complete story of which will be
presented in Mrs. Robinson's special report.
Matthew Fontaine Maury
Every five years a board of electors from all sections of the
country meets to select the names of distinguished Americans to
be placed in the Hall of Fame of New York University. The
nomination lists for this purpose were open to the public on
February 1, 1925. A committee representing the United Daughters
of the Confederacy, with Mrs. Alfred Cochran of New York as
chairman, submitted the name of Matthew Fontaine Maury, "The
Pathfinder of the Seas" for this honor. Mrs. Cochran will report
on the progress made.
The Matthew Fontaine Maury Prize is awarded annually by our
organization. It is given to the student attaining the highest
marks in Physics at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.
The prize is a pair of marine binoculars. The winner of the
prize this year was Midshipman John William Bays, an instructor
at Culver Military Academy, Culver, Indiana.
Collection of Books for Foreign Libraries
More than four thousand volumes on Southern History and
Literature are now in foreign libraries. The credit for this is
due to our committee, the chairman of which is Miss Elizabeth
Hanna. The Bodleian Library, Oxford England, contains many of
our standard works on Southern History and Literature; between
75 and 100 valuable Southern books have been placed at the


## p. 60 (#64) ##############################################

60 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Sarbonne, the great French library at Paris, and one of the most
important of all these collections is at the American Library in
Paris. The Dulaney collection has been placed in the Parliamen-
tary Library at Ottowa, Canada. This library had its beginning
with a contribution of $50.00 from Colonel Dulaney's daughter as
a memorial to her father.
It may interest the Convention to know that there is in the col-
lection at the Bodleian Library one of the few complete files of
the Confederate Veteran in bound volumes up to 1920. (Applause).
This library and the American Library in Paris, the Parliamentary
Library of Canada and a Library at Weisbaden, Germany are all
on the mailing list of the Veteran.
At the Savannah Convention Miss Hanna reported that many
of the foreign libraries are now supplied with the most valuable
of our standard books on Southern Literature. She recommended
that hereafter only recent publications should be sent abroad.
History
"Loyalty to the truth of Confederate History" is the keystone
of our organization. As Daughters of the Confederacy, then, our
most obvious duty is to preserve for future generations all ma-
terial concerning Southern History. And while laying this foun-
dation to a worthy and distinctive past we must be mindful that
it is for the good of our posterity also that we build. Every
thought and action must be directed toward spanning the chasm
of time which separates the glorious achievements of the Con-
federacy from the irresistible call of the ever-ascending march of
progress.
Sixty years ago the War Between the States closed. Within
ten years few of our soldiers will be left. Very soon our beloved
organization will become entirely historical and memorial. Our
responsibility as Daughters of the Confederacy will be, more and
more, to place in the hands of all students the actual, reliable
and fundamental account of that part of American History made
by the South.
Asking only for truth and justice, knowing that in them are
honor and glory enough for all, we seek to perpetuate the truths
of Southern History and to search out and immortalize its facts and
traditions. Can we not, as Daughters of the Confederacy, be
widq-awake press agents for the South?
In her report last year the President-General urged, each Division
President to appoint a committee to prepare a history of the work
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in her own Division.
In many of the Divisions this suggestion has been promptly carried
out.
Your attention is called to the intensive work done during the
past year in the department of the Historian-General, Mrs. St.
John A. Lawton. The History Committee and two sub-committees
have been very actively engaged.
The Historian-General is Chairman of the Standing Committee
on History; Miss Elizabeth Hanna is Vice-Chairman of the sub-


## p. 61 (#65) ##############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 61
committee on Southern History and Endorsement of Books, and
Mrs. John Anderson is Vice-Chairman of the sub-committee known
as the Rutherford History Committee. They will report a vast
amount of historical research work accomplished since we last
convened.
This combination of history committees was made following
a recommendation to that effect adopted at the Savannah Conven-
tion. It is for the purpose of co-ordinating the work and avoiding
confusion and duplication.
In perpetuating and preserving the true history of the South,
our History Department has assumed one of the most vital under-
takings of our organization. Adequate financial resources are
necessary to promote this work. Both of these facts were offi-
cially recognized at the last Convention when there was unani-
mously passed a recommendation that the United Daughters of the
Confederacy established a fund of $30,000 to be known as the
Historical Foundation Fund. This money is to be raised by
voluntary contributions from Divisions, Chapters and individuals.
The first work planned by the committee is the producing and
showing of a motion picture which embodies the history of the
South. The interest manifested in this fund is most gratifying
to the President-General and she urges you to increase your efforts
to complete this endowment.
The Tennessee Division is to be congratulated upon its splendid
program of raising a fund for a building at Peabody College for
Teachers in Nashville, Tennessee. (Applause). This building
is to be used as a home for girls of Confederate descent. Forty
thousand dollars of the fund has already been pledged. When
this undertaking is completed Peabody College, through its presi-
dent, has pledged the establishment of a Chair of Southern His-
tory. (Applause)
The American Legion History of the United States
Your committee reports through Dr. Matthew Page Andrews
that these two volumes are practically ready for publication.
Tentatively the volumes have already been issued. They are go-
ing through a final revision. Dr. Andrews reports that these
volumes are as non-sectional as text books can be in this country,
and that the suggestions of your committee and other representa-
tives of Southern organizations were not only respectfully
considered but heeded. For example, the origin of our political
institutions and the founding of the first free assembly is made
clear as in no history that has been offered even by Southern
authors now used in Southern schools. (Applause). It is, of
course the truth. Otherwise it would have met with the over-
whelming objections of those who have predilections in favor
of the former erroneous versions. This is one of the examples
of the tremendous improvement made over the text books we
now have. It is believed that if this book is generally used
throughout the Union the ideas of the children of the country
will be liberalized from Maine to California. The presentation
of these books has sbown that men and women who interpret
their communities and sections in terms of the whole can get
together on a reasonable basis and these volumes should do much

62 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
to teach the truth and promote the objects for which we are
contending.
Lee Memorial Chapel
At the 31st Annual Convention, the Lee Memorial Chapel Com-
mittee recommended that the Lee Memorial Chapel Fund be con)-
verted into a Lee Memorial Trust Fund to be held for a term of
years. This recommendation has the endorsement of your
PresidentnGeneral.
Since the money, which now amounts to $1550.73, was donated
for the chapel at Washington and Lee University and since plans
for the work have been withdrawn, it would be difficult to return
the money to the donors and illegal to divert the fund without
the consent of the donors. The recommendation is the outcome
of the serious thought and investigation given to the legal and
other phases of the question by the committee and the President-
General hopes that the Convention will vote to convert the fund
into the Lee Memorial Trust Fund.
Arlington To Be Restored
"Arlington," the Lee mansion in the National Cemetery, is to be
restored to its original splendor. (Applause) This is in line
with America's awakened interest in the preservation of historic
spots. The spirit of the day demands a rejuvenating of the glories
of our past.
A bill passed by Congress last March authorized and directed
the Secretary of War to carry out this project. As nearly as is
practicable the mansion will be restored to its condition preceding
the War Between the States. At that time it was the home of
Robert E. Lee, then Colonel, U. S. A., and destined to become a
world hero forever. (Applause).
The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by
Mr. Cranton of Michigan, and in the Senate, without amendment,
by Mr. Pepper of Pennsylvania—both Northerners. (Applause).
While no appropriation was made, the estimates for the pro-
ject have been submitted to the bureau of budgets by the Quarter-
master-General of the army, General William H. Hart. Undoubt-
edly Congress will authorize an appropriation for the necessary
$225,000 at its coming session.
When properly renovated, Arlington will join the stately
pageant of historic scenes and will take its place with the other
fine old landmarks in and near the National Capital that have
become shrines of the nation.
"It's a happy sign in a busy world that no matter whither paths
lead, the spell of the old South ever calls, its glories never die
nor romance fade. Like an old song, its mellow charm rings
through time's dim hall."
Memorial Approach To Arlington
A Memorial Bridge over the Potomac river at Washington is
to connect the National Memorial Cemetery with the Capital City.
\


## p. 63 (#67) ##############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 63
Since the approach to the mansion is to be a part of this memorial
plan the President-General was empowered to appoint a com-
mittee to represent the United Daughters of the Confederacy in
an effort to secure recognition for the organization and the priv-
ilege of having a part in building this Memorial Approach to Ar-
lington. Mrs. Roy Weaks McKinney is chairman of this committee
and will bring an interesting report to the convention.
The Yale University Press Photo-Plays
As time goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that this
effort on the part of the Yale University Press to present history
in moving pictures is the outstanding achievement of our time.
Old errors and misconceptions are swept away and it is necessary
to see only one or two of these pictures to understand what this
means. The Yale University Press has completed the following
pictures: Columbus, Jamestown, The Pilgrims, The Puritans, Peter
Stuyvesant, The Gateway to the West, Wolfe and Montcalm, The
Eve of the Revolution, The Declaration of Independence, York-
town, Vincennes, Daniel Boone, The Frontier Woman, Alexander
Hamilton and Dixie. The Lee and the Confederacy film which is
being prepared by Dr. Andrews will be released in a few months.
Dr. Andrews has been connected with the making of these pic-
tures as far as he has been able to be present. It will be recalled
that he agreed to represent the United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy; but that there were no funds set aside to enable him to
visit New York to observe the pictures in the process of prepara-
tion.
Jefferson Davis Highway
"To further honor the name of the great statesman and soldier
whose memory is engraved on the hearts of all true sons of the
South," the United Daughters of the Confederacy is promoting
the Jefferson Davis Highway. This is a work of stupendous pro-
portion, vast importance and untold value historically. It is the
only transcontinental route ever sponsored by a woman's organi-
zation. This fact alone should be sufficient to make us bend every
effort to show that we are fully capable of doi,ng a work of such
gigantic magnitude.
"What lessons in history, what monuments in stone or bronze
could so bring to the minds of the American people the duty we
owe this great American as a wonderful Highway reaching from
Ocean to Ocean?"
There are 3417 miles on the Highway. There are 242 chapters
in States not on the Highway. The committee hopes to secure
from these chapters $14.00 each—a dollar a mile. These contri-
butions to be used in printing maps and in publishing a road book,
giving mileage, illustrated with pictures of historic places.
Granite markers are being placed along the way. These will
be an evidence to travellers that the President of the Confederacy
still lives in the memory of Southerners. (Applause). They will
show that in the citadels of our affections his name, his charac-
ter and his service are safe and secure against all attacks.
(Applause).

64 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
During the past year much progress has been made by the com-
mittee and will be reported by the capable chairman, Mrs. John
L. Woodbury of Kentucky.
The Cross of Service
Under the leadership of Mrs. John A. Rountree, chairman, in-
valuable work has been accomplished by the Committee on Insignia
for Confederate Descendants in the World War. Mrs. W. H.
Estabrook, Custodian of the Crosses of Honor, reports that 1245
Crosses of Service and 627 Crosses of Honor have been bestowed
during the year.
Many of the greatest leaders and heroes of the World War were
sons and grandsons of Confederate Veterans. There was, how-
ever, no recognition of the link of valor between the two gent-
erations until the United Daughters of the Confederacy adopted
the Cross of Service. This medal was designed by Chester Beach
of New York and bears this symbolic inscription: "The Brave
Give Birth to the Brave."
The tender of this Cross of Service to soldiers, sailors and
marines of the World War, whose ancestors were Confederate
Veterans, is one of the outstanding features of our work. In
this way, in visible form, we express our gratitude and seek to
keep correct the record of achievements by these soldiers of two
generations.
By unanimous vote of the members of the Executive Board,
requests for this medal from the Smithsonian Institute and the
American Numismatic Society were granted, and Crosses have
been forwarded by the Custodian of Crosses to be included in
both of these famous collections of war medals.
Official Business
The rapid growth of our Society is most gratifying to your
President-General. During the past year there has come to her
desk a constantly increasing volume of official correspondence
which has necessitated an amount of detailed attention hardly to be
appreciated by the Daughters. In the twelve months 3,500 letters
have been written.
Some of the correspondence has been connected only indirectly
with the work of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. But
many letters have carried touching appeals; many have presented
problems deserving the most careful consideration and all have
been entitled to a courteous reply.
While this noticeable increase in mail has meant additional
expenditure of effort it has carried with it the recompense of a
greater opportunity to contact the trend of popular thought con-
cerning the activities of our association. It has opened the way
to a broader vision and an enlarged field for service.


## p. 65 (#69) ##############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 65
The report of your Recording Secretary-General shows that
thirty-three new chapters have been organized and chartered
during 1925, two of which are to the credit of Alabama; one to
Mississippi; one to Colorado; one to Oregon; one to Arkansas;
two to West Virginia; three to Florida; three to Tennessee; three
to California; three to Texas; four to Virginia; nine to South
Carolina. (Applause).
In 1924, the Bonnie Blue Flag Chapter at Dallas, Texas, organ-
ized a Chapter with 113 Charter members.
On July 21, 1925, the Elloree Chapter at Elloree, S. C, was or-
ganized with a Charter membership of 119. (Applause.)
It is with peculiar pride that the President-General announces
that these chapters were organized during her administration.
Connecticut will shortly become the 39th State to boast one
or more chapters of our organization within its bounds. An
earnest group of women there have completed plans for securing
a charter.
It is generally conceded that committee work largely deter-
mines the strength and effectiveness of any organization. In view
of this fact, it is a pleasure to be able to report that all of our
General Committees have been functioning splendidly and heroic-
ally. This may be due, in part at least, to the practice of making
appointments solely upon the basis of particular fitness for the
type of work to be done by the committee. With greater efficiency
as a goal the President-General secured the consent of each mem-
ber and chairman to render genuine service before final approval
was given to any appointment.
Following the custom of many years, your President-General
endorsed the plea of the R. E. Lee Chapter, Columbus, Ohio, to
solicit, through circular letters, chapters of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy with a request for flowers and contributions
to decorate the graves of the Confederate soldiers at Camp Chase
Cemetery.
Americanism Conference
Our Society co-operated with the National Americanism Com-
mission of the American Legion in a conference, October 4. 1925.
This conference was in the nature of an open forum for the dis-
cussion of those things calculated to bring about a deeper interest
in the affairs of our nation. Mrs. Chester Garfield, President of
the California Division, represented the organization at the coni-
ference.
Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation
Plans are being perfected by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
Association for the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the
signing of the Declaration of Independence. Mrs. Livingston
Rowe Schuyler heads a special committee which was authorized


## p. 66 (#70) ##############################################

to co-operate with the Association in this project. The committee
was also authorized to contribute for our organization one thou-
sand dollars ($1,000.00) toward the purchase of Monticello, the
home of Thomas Jefferson.
Memorials
Monuments built by the United Daughters of the Confederacy,
it is said, exceed in number those erected by any other patriotic
body.
During the year now ending many memorials and monuments
to the soldiers and women of the Confederacy have been un-
veiled. Each gives eloquent evidence of the fidelity of the South
and each will impress upon generations to come the principles
for which our heroes of the past died. It was with deepest regret
that your President-General found it impossible to accept many
of the invitations to be present on these important occasions.
As the members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
have so faithfully contributed their time and talents toward these
memorials, the report of the President-General would be incom-
plete unless mention is made of the most important monuments
erected since our last Convention.
Commemorating the Battle of Sabine Pass and the wonderful
bravery of Lieutenant Dick Dowling and his company of forty-one
Confederate soldiers, a monument was recently unveiled on the
site of the historic battlefield in Texas.
The monument to Captain Sally Tompkins, C. S. A., was dedi-
cated on June 3rd, in the cemetery of Christ Church, Mathews,
Virginia.
"To the memory of Confederate soldiers who have died or may
die on the Pacific coast"—the first Confederate monument in the
West was dedicated in the cemetery at Hollywood, California,
June 6, 1925.
During President McKinley's administration the U. S. Govern-
ment erected a monument to the Confederate dead of Fort Dela-
ware, New Jersey. As no special commemoration was observed
at the time of the erection the members of the Philadelphia Chap-
ter arranged a dedication service in October which was most
impressive.
At Oak Bluff, Massachusetts on the Isle of Martha's Vineyard,
September 4, 1925, a tablet was unveiled to the memory of the
Confederate soldiers. On the bronze are inscribed words that,
should warm every heart within the bounds of the republic:
"The chasm is closed.
In memory of the Restored Union
This tablet is dedicated by the Union
Veterans and patriotic men and women of
Martha's Vineyard to the Confederate soldiers." (Applause)
Representing the United Daughters of the Confederacy at the
exercises were Mrs. R. H. Chesley, Corresponding Secretary-
General and Mrs. Armstrong Swartout, President of the Boston
Chapter.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 67
To The "Lafayette of the Confederacy"
Immediately upon organizing the Major-General de Polignac
Chapter in Paris, France, the members began to plan for the erec-
tion of a monument on the battlefield at Mansfield, Louisiana.
The inspiration of this idea was Major-General de Polignac who,
when General Mouton fell, "sprang to the head of the troops to
take the fallen leader's place and bear them to victory." April
8, 1925, the sixty-first anniversary of the battle, saw the fruition
of their plans. On that day there was unveiled in Mansfield Battle-
field Park the beautiful shaft of Georgia granite from Stone Moun-
tain. Among the thousands of distinguished people who were
present the Prince Victor Mansfield de Polignac and his mother,
Princess Camille de Polignac, held the center of interest. With
gray-clad veterans standing about him, some of whom had fought
under his father, and while the strains of the Marseillaise swelled
upon the air, the young Prince unveiled the monument to his
father. In a short but eloquent address he paid high tribute to
General Taylor and to General Mouton and to others whose gal-
lantry on the field had helped to win the battle. He also re-
counted to his interested hearers the earnest efforts made by his
father to serve the Confederacy at various times and in different
ways.
The United Daughters of the Confederacy of Louisiana and
of Mansfield had planned most admirably to make this an epoch
in the history of the Division, and every possible success crowned
their efforts.
Stone Mountain Memorial Coin
At the Reunion of the United Confederate Veterans at Dallas,
Texas, your President-General accepted in your name from the
President of the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association
one of these beautiful Memorial coins, the 7th coin minted. To
us of the Southland these coins are sacred tokens for they bear
the graven figures of Lee and Jackson on their chargers. But the
noblest sentiment on the coin is contained in the words, "To the
Valor of the Soldier of the South."
Passed unanimously by Congress and readily approved by the
President of the United States, the minting of these coins was the
most chivalric act in the annals of the American Government,
(applause) No other nation in recorded time has struck off such
a memorial to its former antagonists. The law under which this
gracious tribute was rendered is written not only on the statute
books, but in the hearts of a united people.
Surely the day is not far distant when Jefferson Davis' prophecy
will come true: "When time shall have softened passion and
prejudice; when reason shall have stripped her mask from mis-
representation, then justice, holding evenly her scales, will require
much of past censure and praise to change places."
Official Visits
Of the many stimulating and delightful duties with which your
President-General is engaged, perhaps, the one which brings her
the greatest measure of joy and satisfaction is her experience of

68 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
visiting officially the Division Conventions, Chapter meetings and
special celebrations. These visits bring her in personal contact
with the individual members of the Society. Moreover, they en-
able her to gain an invaluable knowledge of state and local affairs,
which helps tremendously in the administration of her office.
It has been the privilege of your President-General to be the
guest of eighty Chapters of the United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy in fifteen States, (applause) Wherever our great organi-
zation is represented she found the work being carried on with
splendid spirit and enthusiasm, a condition which was most en-
couraging and inspiring.
During the year just passed your President-General has covered
a vast area in the performance of this duty of her office.
The round of official calls began last December with the con-
vention of the Texas Division at Houston. All business meetings
of this Convention were featured by interesting reports of various
officers.
Circumstances compelled the President-General to cancel the
invitation she had previously accepted to attend the Convention
of the South Carolina Division.
January saw three official visits to Georgia chapters and a con-
ference with the Executive Board of the Georgia Division at
Macon.
Early in April the Princess Camille de Polignac and her son,
Prince Victor Mansfield de Polignac, of Paris France, accompanied
by Miss Mary Poppenheim, of Charleston, S. C., former President-
General, spent a day in Atlanta, Georgia, en route to Mansfield,
Louisiana, to be present at the unveiling of the monument to
General de Polignac, C. S. A.
The Marquise de Coutrivon, President of the Major-iGeneral de
Polignac Chapter in Paris, and the daughter of the Princess de
Polignac, wrote the President-General of the contemplated visit,
giving her the itinerary of the visitors while in America.
It was a memorable pleasure to meet the distinguished visitors
in Atlanta and welcome them, personally, to our Southland and
extend greetings from the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
On April 26, your President-General left her home for a long
tour over the great West and Southwest, for the purpose of visiting
officially many of the splendid Chapters of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy which dot the sunny States of the Far West
and the Pacific Coast.
En route, the first stop was at St. Louis, where opportunity was
given to meet many Daughters of that city. At Kansas City, the
following day, five local Chapters were hosts at a luncheon at
which 200 guests were present. At Denver, the Colorado Daugh-
ters gave a delightful banquet, entertaining 300 guests. On both
of these occasions the President-General carried your message to
the earnest workers of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
Passing through Pueblo, Colorado, an unexpected pleasure was
vouchsafed your President-General, when she was enabled to
meet the entire membership of the Nathan B. Forrest Chapter.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 69
Perfect hospitality was showered on your President-General in
San Francisco, where she stayed as the guest of the California
Division. Mrs. C. C. Clay, former President of the Division, was
her first hostess in the Golden State. While in San Francisco
there came also the privilege of extending greetings in the name
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to 500 members of
the San Francisco Music Club, assembled in banquet.
On May 11, the San Francisco Bay Chapters gave a brilliant
reception at the Fairmont Hotel, where the President-General and
the Division President, Mrs. Garfield, were guests of honor.
The Annual Convention of the California Division began the
following day, May 12, at San Jose, and the President-General
was particularly pleased with the reports delivered on .this oc-
casion.
Your President«General delivered an address on Historical
Evening which she prefaced by a message of greetings and good
wishes from the general organisation. Numerous other opportun-
ities were opened for the President-General to tell of our encour-
aging growth. The work on the coast has been widely developed
through the capable guidance of Mrs. Chester Garfield, the Division
President, and the California Convention was memorable for its
interest and inspiration.
From San Jose the Presidenb-General and the Division President
travelled together to Los Angeles, where a welcome marked by
genuine cordiality was extended. The President of the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce and 30 representatives of the
eight United Daughters of the Confederacy Chapters in the city
met the train, each bearing great armfuls of flowers.
A luncheon in honor of the President-General was given by
the Pasadena Chapter, at which she made an address before re-
presentatives of the various Chapters from Pasadena, Los Angeles,
Riverside, Colton and Long Beach.
Further opportunity to meet the members of the Los Angeles
Chapters came at a tea given the President-General at the house
of Mrs. Charles Wellborn, President of the Los Angeles Chapter.
While many of the California Daughters were old friends, this
visit gave the President-General a new conception of the brilliance
and charm of the leaders of our Society in the Far West. Every
Chapter there vied with the others in extending hospitality.
At El Paso, Texas, where one day was spent, a reception was
given by the members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
at the El Paso Woman's Club. Special welcome was received not
only from the Daughters, but from representatives of the various
civic bodies in that city. In responding, the President-General
stressed the aims and functions of the general organization.
The next stop was at Dallas, Texas, where your President-Gen-
eral served as Matron of Honor for the South on the staff of
General James A. Thomas, Commander-in-Chief, U. C. V., at the
Confederate Reunion. She extended greetings from the United
Daughters of the Confederacy both to the United Confederate
Veterans and to the Confederate Memorial Association.


## p. 70 (#74) ##############################################

70 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Here your President-General was more impressed than ever
with the fact that our Confederate soldiers are loved, honored
and remembered by the Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy
everywhere.
Many courtesies were enjoyed during the Reunion. A new
feature added to the Reunion program at the suggestion of your
President-General was a dinner given for the Division Presidents.
This was in line with the annual Presidents' Dinner given at the
Conventions of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
From Dallas the President-General went to Fort Worth, Texas,
where at a garden party given at the home of /General and Mrs.
K. M. Van Zandt, by the Julia Jackson Chapter, she made an ad-
dress on the work of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
to more than 300 Daughters, Veterans, Sons and Children of the
Confederacy.
A conference with officers of the ScotthDickson Chapter at Mc-
Kinney .Texas, occupied another day.
June 3rd was spent with the Hawkinsville, Georgia, Chapter.
On this occasion 37 Crosses of Service were delivered to World
War Veterans and 25 Crosses of Honor to Veterans of the War
Between the States.
Arduous as was the long journey to the Pacific Coast with its
many official duties, your President-General is sensible of the
great tribute paid to our organization by the honors bestowed
upon her as your representative. She feels, also, that there came
to her a privilege, not likely to be repeated in a lifetime, a rich
opportunity for broadcasting not only to our own members, but
to the general public as well, the great facts concerning the vast-
ness of the work of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
Even with the miracles of modern transportation it was im-
possible to arrange a fuller schedule and invitations from States
and Chapters had to be declined.
In making new friendships and in renewing early friendships,
in meeting face to face our dear Confederate soldiers in many
cities, this journey in the name of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy will ever remain in the depths of my heart, as a
march of triumphal happiness.
Conclusion
On a famous sundial there is this inscription: "I record none
but hours of sunshine." During the past two years spent with
the United Daughters of the Confederacy, your President-General's
heart, like this dial, has recorded nothing but hours of sunshine
as she has watched over the progress and well-being of our won-
derful Organization. She glories in the thought of the lovely picture
these hours will make when hung on her memory wall of the
years to come.
To every one, to every officer from the First Vice-President-
General to the head of our smallest Chapter, your President-
General is indebted for hearty co-operation and enthusiastic ser-
vice. Her heart goes out to you in loving appreciation for your
\

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 71
loyal support in all that we have attempted. She has learned to
know you and your true worth. And now, at the close of her
administration she can unhesitatingly say there is no task the
enormity of which is too great for you to accomplish. (Applause)
Your President-General has unlimited faith in the successful
future of our great organization. Looking forward, she sees
the Daughters of the Confederacy an ever steadying force of
patriotic endeavor, a molder and initiator of public opinion, a tre-
mendous power for good fostering all worthy causes with unself-
ish ideals—one vast army of right thinking women pledged to
champion only those things which will exalt a nation.
"No man shall place a limit on thy strength!
Such triumphs as no mortal ever gained
May yet be thine, if thou wilt but believe
In thy Creator and thyself. At last
Some feet will tread all heights now unattained,
Why not thine own? Press on! Achieve! Achieve!"
Respectfully submitted,

Madam President-General and Members of the Convention:
As promptly as possible after the close of the Convention in
Savannah, 3600 copies of the minutes were printed and distributed
to the Chapters in 37 States and France.
It has been gratifying to receive requests from Public Libraries
all over the Country for copies of the Minutes of our great Organi-
zation.
No new State has been added to our roll during the past year,

of having organized the Chapter with the largest number of char-
ter members at Elloree with 119 members; Texas 4; Virginia 4;

Arkansas 1; Colorado 1; Mississippi 1; Oregon 1.
Duplicate charters have been issued to 4 Chapters and one,
Upton Hays, of Kansas City, Missouri, has been cancelled.
Errors made on the charters will be avoided if each application
is accompanied by a type written copy and if the official charter
application blank is used so that it may be kept for the Recording
Secretary's records, she will be relieved that extra typing.
When sending ith.e rosters to the Corresponding Secretary
General for the minutes, will the Division Secretaries please only
list the active Chapters so that their lists will correspond with
those of the Treasurert-General.
Printing ordered through this office during the year has been
as follows:

Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy:
It was a great satisfaction to have compiled the rosters of so
many chapters so as to be able to have them in the hands of the
printer for the Savannah Minutes to be issued on time.
Since that work w;as finished, it has been my privilege to send
out eight hundred (800) notices and letters of appointments dur-
ing the past year.
The lists of our deceased members that have been received have
been put in uniform order and typed ready for the next edition of
the Minutes.
I wish to thank the different states for the cordial invitations
to attend their Annual Conventions, and to wish for them years
of prosperity in the work.
It was an unusual honor to be your representative on the oc-
casion of the unveiling of a tablet to the memory of the Con-
federate Soldiers at Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts in September.
Time is indeed, bringing about the fulfillment of the right spirit

96 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The Historian-General, Mrs. St. John A. Lawton, read
her report, which upon motion of Mrs. Anderson, was
accepted with thanks without its recommendations for
her three years of wonderful work for our organization.
REPORT OF THE HISTORIAN-GENERAL
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy:
Notwithstanding the fact that great Southern Newspapers and
mighty Publishing Houses are using their powerful influence
against having the Southern viewt-point shown in Histories and
textbooks used in Southern schools; notwithstanding that we read
in a letter from a professor of History in the University of one
of our proudest Southern States, "In the twelve years that I have
been here I have received seven entrance examination papers
which could not identify Jefferson Davis, while all of them easily
identified Abraham Lincoln;" notwithstanding the fact that in
our public schools there are given as examples for character build-
ing, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry Ward Beecher, Lincoln, Sher-
man, Sheridan and John Brown; and notwithstanding, that some
school boards seem to prefer busts and portraits of these, to be
placed in schools as an inspiration to the young, rather than
busts of such men as Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, and
Robert E. Lee; notwithstanding such distressing instances as
these occuring constantly in the experience of each of the Division
Historians, we are not down-hearted. We are swimming against
a mighty tide—but we are swimming, and if our strength and de-
termination only hold out, the tide will turn and the South will
come into her own!
We have a tremendous purpose, and by that purpose we are
exalted to a most valid greatness. Let us realize the value of
our position in this labor of love for the dead, and of watchful-
ness for future generations.
However vital is our work in other fields of endeavor, no de-
partment of our activities is more weighted •with responsibility
than this of presenting to the World, true history.
Let us remember at all times that vituperation is not argument;
but that, "the truth has the power to make itself felt."
Concerning the $30,000.00 Historical Foundation undertaken last
year, and the plan to produce an Historical Moving Picture; let us
call attention to the fact that the History Committee consisting of
the Division Historians has charge of raising this Foundation,
therefore it is not listed with Special Committees. It is hoped that
all Division Historians during the year and particularly at the time
of State Conventions will urge their Chapters to contribute to this
Foundation, without which out historical work is financially at
a standstill.
The publicity Manager for the Fox Film Corporation of New
York was interviewed concerning the cost of producing a Mov-
ing Picture on the order of America. He stated the cost was stu-
\

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 97
pendous, reaching into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and
that the principals would "eat up the Fifty Thousand in short or-
der."
It is still the vision and the hope of this Department to some
day be able to show history by means of a great Moving Picture,
a metbod of interesting and teaching, unsurpassed in our opinion.
Therefore, let usj keep in mind and work toward that goal.
These have been filed in this office, the Minutes of the follow-
ing Divisions: New York, North Carolina, S. Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, California, and
the following pamphlets and poems:
"Jefferson Davis," by Long; "Right of Secession," by Mrs. John
Weinmann; "The Battle of Mansfield, La.," "Lincoln, the Free-
thinker," by Joseph Lewis.
Poems: "The IGreat Obelisk and Irrigation," by Grace Murray
Martin, of Kentucky; "The Folded Banner," by S. A. Steel, of
Mansfield, La.
Year Books from Jefferson Davis Chapter, Cleveland, Tenn.,;
Year Books from the Florida Division.
"Information and Suggestions," by Miss Rutherford, Georgia Dif-
vision Program.
Program of Exercises of North Carolina Day; Program Armistice
Day in Florida with sketch of Major-General Chas. P. Summer-
all, U. S. Army; Program of The LaFayette Centennial of St. Louis.
"Lincoln, a Southern View," by Rutledge, published by Leonidas
Polk, Chapter, North Carolina.
Information concerning a tablet in honor of Confederate Sol-
diers placed by patriotic Societies of Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
Also information concerning the fact that the Hon. Jefferson Dav-
is, on August 4, 1858, had conferred upon] him by Bowdoin College,
Brunswick, Maine, one of its highest honors, the degree of Doctor
of Laws. The College never rescinded it.
The work of the Division Historians has been very inspiring,
and their co-operation most helpful and greatly valued.
The reports received by the Historian-General are in many cases
so excellent that it is deplored that they have to be cut and con-
densed in order to conform to the By-Laws governing the Histo-
rian-General's report.
PHILADELPHIA CHAPTER
Mrs. Thos. Franklin Morgan, historian of Philadelphia Chapter,
United Daughters of the Confederacy No. 972, states that:
Great interest and earnestness of purpose in all their undertak-
ings has been manifested during the year.
The quota for the Chapter of "The Women of the South in War
Times" has been passed.


## p. 98 (#102) #############################################

98 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Two books, "Recollections and Letters of Gen. R. E. Lee," by his
son, Capt. R. E. Lee, and "The Life of Gen. Lee," by Sir Robert
Maurice, have been pin-chased.
All the members are now subscribers to the Veteran.
At the celebration of the one hundred and eighteenth anniver*
sary of the birth of Gen. Lee, January 19, 1925, eleven Crosses of
Service, were bestowed on descendants of Confederate Veterans
who had served in the World War.
The appropriations and donations for education have amounted
to $700.00
The Chapter has given $619.21 to benevolent work, and contrib-
uted $130.00 to the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship.
On Saturday, October 17, 1925, the Chapter dedicated the inn-
posing granite monument erected by the United States Government
at Finn's Point National Cemetery, on the Delaware River, near
Pennsgrove, N. J. This monument marks the graves of two thous-
and four hundred and thirty-six Confederate Soldiers who died in
a prison at Fort Delaware, and was erected in 1909, fulfilling a
promise made by President McKinley several years before while
on a campaign tour in Alabama. It was discovered recently by the
Chapter that the monument had not been dedicated.
MARYLAND DIVISION
Mrs. E. K. Wormon, Historian of Maryland Division submits a
splendid history of the Maryland Division, compiled during the
year. She reports that the birthdays of Lee, Davis, Jackson, Maury
and Semmes have been duly observed.
Six Historical meetings have been held and valuable papers
read.

"Dixie," to an enthusiastic audience of sixteen hundred people,

tions to the "Confederate Veteran" are given three Veterans who
otherwise wou.ld not see the Magazine.
Two valuable relics were collected. The Vicksburg Daily Cit-
izen, printed on wall paper, July 2, 1863, and a1 portion of a speech
on General Lee, made years ago by Benj. H. Hill.
VIRGINIA DIVISION
The Virginia Division under the enthusiastic and able direction
of Miss Annie Mann, the Division Historian, has accomplished great
things again.
The Historian has received from every Chapter a report, to se-
cure which, entailed labor of sending out circular letters to each
Chapter and Writing 500 postals.


## p. 99 (#103) #############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 99

Our book store where young, graded and High School, and Wash-
ington and Lee boys buy their books is a Forum, where from the
discussion one might think that it was but yesterday that Lee,

streets. One corner of the store is a Lee Gallery, another a Stone-
wall Jackson Gallery, and the Confederate Flag ever waves here."

rian, which has gone to the press. The expense of the publishing
of this splendid volume is being paid by the Georgia Division.
Two members of the Georgia Division have given Loving Cups
to General Organization. Mrs. John A. Perdue, a Loving Cup—
"Offered the Division submitting the most valuable list of books
on Confederate History—which list must include a separate list of
books fori young people—this cup to be competed for annually."
The Blount Memorial Cup—"offered by Mrs. Walter Lamar, in
memory of her Father and Brother—to the Division bestowing the
greatest number of Crosses of Service during the year—to be
competed for annually."
A valuable pamphlet written by Miss Rutherford, and published
by the Georgia Division on "The History of the Cross of Honor and
Service Cross. Miss Rutherford wrote this pamphlet to give in
formation to the Children in the State for their Essays, in Histor-
ical Essay Contest—that being the subject for Essays this year.

A History of Lumden's Battery, C. S. A., was published by the
R. E. Rodes Chapter, Tuscaloosa, and is interesting and attrac-
tive. It is bound in heavy card board, printed on enamel paper
and has several illustrations.
The Historian had planned to publish a book on "The Work of
the United Daughters of the Confederacy in Alabama," and had
hoped to have it completed before the Convention, but for several
reasons could not carry out her plans. However, the work has
been started, she has given a good deal of time to it, and hopes to
finish it with credit to the Division.
One Historian reported that in the City Schools several of the
teachers have Southern Historical afternoons every Friday, and
the pupils taking part in conducting these exercises have shown
enthusiastic interest.

MRS. CHAS. L. LYTTLE, Historian, .
Mrs. Charles R. Hyde, when Historian-General, called our at-
tention to the need of a History of the General Organization at
such time as the United Daughters of the Confederacy felt finany-
cially able to undertake it.
During the last three years many requests have come from va-
rious parts of the country, for information as to the Origin of the
Organization; as to the history of the Monuments erected, the cost,
the sculptors; as to the great work done during the War; as to the
Educational work, and the care for our women.
All of these requests would seem to indicate that here exists a
need and a demand for a History of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy in some concise form to save referring to the past
copies of Minutes, which copies with some new Chapters are un-
attainable, therefore, the following recommendation is offered:
That the next administration appoint a Committee consisting of
seven:
3 Ex-Presidents-General
2 Ex-Historians-General
2 Exj-Recording-Secretaries-General
to prepare and have published in suitable and reasonable form, a
History of the 32 years of the life of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy; that the manuscript and estimates of the cost be
ready for the next General Convention of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy, if feasible.
Realizing the importance of having definite knowledge avail-
able as to the World War Veterans who have been decorated by
this organization, the following recommendation is offered:
That this organization devote a leaf of the General Minutes or
as many leaves as may be necessary, to the names of those World
War Veterans who have been decorated by the General Organiza-
tion in Convention Assembled, giving their rank, their native State
and the date and place of decoration.
A list of books which we believe will be found useful is here-
with submitted, with no thought of endorsing these volumes
throughout, as many contain sentiments foreign to our belief, but
they are submitted with the idea that from each may be gleaned
much of value, in studying Southern and American History.
In studying the life of Robert E. Lee we would call your atten-
tion to three books.
"Robert E. Lee, the Southerner,"' by Thomas Nelson Page.
"Lee, the American," by Gamaliel Bradford.

iar quotation from Father Ryan; and being reminded of its beauty
and appropriateness, I feel that we should take it with us as our
guidance and inspiration.
"Keep faithful watch and true
For the living and dead of the conquered land
Have now no guard save you1."
Respectfully submitted,
RUTH LAWTON,
Historian^General.
Mrs. Lawton read her first recommendation.

to prepare and have published in suitable and reasonable form, a
History of the 32 years of the life of the United) Daughters of the
Confederacy; that the manuscript and estimates of the cost be
ready for the next General Convention of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy, if feasible.
After some discussion as to the material to be included
in this data and the cost of publication, etc., Mrs.
Bashinsky, of Alabama, moved that the words "as soon
as feasible" be substituted for "at the next convention."
The recommendation was adopted as amended.
Mrs. Lawton then read her second recommendation
which after some discussion as to its full meaning, the
Chairman agreed to amend to read "by the general organ-
ization of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in
Convention assembled."
Realizing the importance of having definite knowledge avail-
able as to the World War Veterans who have been decorated by
this organization, the following recommendation is offered:
That this organization devote a leaf of the General Minutes or
as many leaves as may be necessary, to the names of those World
War Veterans who have been decorated by the General Organiza-
tion in Convention Assembled, giving their rank, their native State
and the date and place of decoration.
Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, stated that in a pamphlet
in circulation, Miss Mary Poppenheim was given as the
originator of the Cross of Service, while in the report of
the President-General in Washington it was stated that
Major Wallace Streator was the originator.
Miss Poppenheim stated that while she was President-
General she had received a personal letter from Major
Streator stating he would like to see the United Daughters
of the Confederacy offer some recognition to the de-
scendants of Confederate Veterans who were serving in
the World War; that in Tampa, she made the suggestion
to the Convention; that Major Streator had made the
original suggestion to her but had been too modest to
claim credit therefor.
The Registrar-General, Mrs. W. J. Woodliff, read her
report which upon motion of Mrs. Grace was accepted
with a rising vote of thanks.

112 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
REPORT OF REGISTRAR-GENERAL
Madam President-General and Daughters of the Confederacy in
Convention Assembled:
As the office of the Registrar deals principally with hard facts
and plain figures, it leaves little opportunity to indulge in flights
of oratory, which properly belongs to other departments. Also,
knowing that the Divisions are anxious to learn the results of their
work in gathering in new members during the past twelve months,
I shall not keep them in suspense.
It has been a busy year, thirty-four (34) new Chapters having
been added to our roster, as follows:
Alabama 2 Oregon 1
Arkansas 1 South Carolina 9
California 3 Tennessee 3
Colorado 1 Texas 4
Florida _ 3 West Virginia 2
Mississippi 1 Virginia 4
South Carolina not only organized more Chapters than any other
Division, but they have the honor of having the largest Chapter
membership of any Chapter in the organization—the Elloree Chap-
ter, with 119 charter members.
Several of the new Chapters organized with a majority of the
charter members between the ages of 18 and 25, showing that the
younger generation is taking more interest in our work. A total
of 771 "Young Members" were registered this year; of this num-
ber one State, South Carolina, sent in 180, winning the Faris trophy
for this year.
Going to the other extreme, the two oldest members registered
belong to Arkansas and Virginia; Mrs. Cavaness, from Monticello,
Ark., who will be 91 in December; and Miss Catherine Ann Tay-
lor, of Centerville, Virginia, whose birthday also comes in De-
cember, and who was born in 1835.
So far as the records show, the oldest Veteran to sign' an appli-
cation, endorsed that of his grand-daughter to join The Major
Thad Tatum Chapter, at Greenwood, Arkansas; she states on her
papers that her Grandfather was one hundred years old in April,
1925.
Chapters in several Divisions have registered practically whole
families, consisting of the wife (or widow) of a veteran, and from
three to seven daughters, with sometimes a grand-daughter or two
to swell the number.
The honor of registering the most of the new members since last
Convention, belongs to the John McKeller Reynolds Chapter, of
Greenwood, South Carolina; they sent in 133.
During the past twelve months, 8,268 names have added to our
rolls; of these 2,325 are old members, admitted years ago, but who
have never been registered with General Organization. We had
hoped to be able to report every Division one hundred per cent
registered when we met this year, but there are still a few seat-


## p. 113 (#117) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 113
tered Chapters who have not sent in all their papers. However,
our efforts will not cease until every member of every Chapter
has been properly recorded.
38,768 application blanks have been sent out, also 4,436 demit
blanks. Some of the Chapters continue to use the white demit
blanks, which were discarded in 1921; and a few of the older
form without the space for the copy of the record, still make their
appearance. Let us urge the Chapters to destroy all these white
blanks, as they are no longer legal, and cannot be accepted. Your
Division Registrar will supply you with the new demit blanks on
request.
Incomplete papers continue to come in, but your Registrar-Gen-
eral has been successful in securing records for 441 of such ap-
plications, for the most part from the War Department, though
a number came from State Historical Societies and Pension Com-
missioners.
Again let us urge the Chapters to see that applications contain
a full and complete record, with signatures of all the proper of-
ficers, before they are sent to your Division Registrar. Otherwise,
when they reach the office of the Registrarj-General, such papers
must be held until the record is completed; and I can assure you
it is much easier to sign all papers than to write the necessary
letters to secure the information required by the By-Laws.
Before closing, I wish to recommend the purchase of steel files
for this department; also that the Registrar-General may be per-
mitted to employ an assistant, for the work has grown too heavy
for one pair of hands to handle. These two items are necessary in
order that she may send out her work in the perfection it is her
desire to give to everything that leaves her office. As these will
be taken up later, your Registrar will explain at that time her
reasons for making the request.
At the close of this second year of service to the General Or-
ganization. I wish to thank my Division Registrars for their cour-
tesy and forbearance when there has seemed to be unnecessary
delay in the return of papers; and to my President-General I want
to express in my feeble way, my love and appreciation of all she
has been to me; of the help and wise counsel given when discour-
agement has overtaken me; and to feel that in her I have found a
friend.
And again I wish to thank the General Organization for the op-
portunity given me to serve them in the only way I am fitted to
do it. The experience has been wonderful, and the memory of
the work with these wonderful women will be a joy all my life.
Respectfully submitted,
MARION D. WOODLIFF,
Registrar-General.
The President-General announced that the Alexander
Allen Faris Membership Trophy would be given at this
time.

114 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The Registrar-General, Mrs. Woodliff, stated that South
Carolina had sent in the greatest number of new mem-
bers between the ages of 18 and 25 during the year, 180,
and presented the cup to that State. Mrs. Black, Presi-
dent of the South Carolina Division, received the cup for
her State.
Mrs. McKinney, of Kentucky, the donor of the cup, read
the history already engraved thereon and stated that she
would be glad to have South Carolina engraved on it
for the second time.
The Custodian of Crosses of Honor, Mrs. W. H. Esta-
brook, read her report, which upon motion was accepted
with thanks without its recommendations.
REPORT OF CUSTODIAN OF CROSSES OF HONOR
AND SERVICE
Madam President-General and Daughters of the Confederacy:
I come to you bringing the glad tidings of inspiration and
growth. I
During the three years I have had the privilege of serving as
your Custodian of Crosses of Honor, the work has more than
doubled itself. The first year the number of crosses sent out .was
819; the second year, 1923-24, the Cross of Service was added and
I sent 1082; also, sent 629 Crosses of Honor, making 1711 for that
year and; this year, 1924-25, I sent 592 Crosses of Honor and 1294
Crosses of Service, making 1886 for this year and a grand total for
the three years 4416 crosses sent out.
You will notice from the foregoing figures that each year the
number of Crosses of Honor have been growing smaller, thus
showing that the "thin line of gray" is rapidly growing thinner.
Hence, the uTge of the Chapters to see that on each faded coat is
pinned one of our little bronze emblems.
Because of the increased cost of manufacturing the Crosses of
Honor, I recommend that fhe price be changed from 25c to 30c
for each cross.
I have noticed that our Boys who have the Cross of Service are
not allowed to wear it on the outside of the coat with other deco-
rations. And have been requested to present this resolution to
you and urge your favorable action.
And now, in making my last report as youT Custodian, I want
to express grateful thanks for your many kindnesses.
WILLIE HUBERT ESTABROOK.

REPORT OF CUSTODIAN OF FLAGS AND PENNANTS
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy:
Your Flags and Portraits are here once again to greet you. The
Decorating Committee has given them prominent places and have
hung them beautifully. The hand of time is showing its marks upon
the flags and they, like many others of our dear old friends, will
some day soon have to be "laid away."
The expenses incurred by this Office are the expressage to and
from Convention. The flags and one portrait to the Custodian,
and the carriage each way on the portrait of President Davis to
the Convention and back again to the Museum in Richmond, Va.
The ladies in charge at the Museum still kindly care for this por-
trait and hang it most prominently on the wall in the Museum.
The expenses for the year past have been $25.18.

REPORT SECOND VICE-PRESIDENT-GENERAL
Madam President-General United Daughters of the Confederacy:
With the coloring of the leaves in our forests, and the gathering
of the fruits of the harvest, the women who are Daughters of the
Confederacy come, as do the gleaners in the field to render an
account of their labors.
While fewer medals and badges have been ordered than in some
previous years, there has not been a day, except during the three
summer months, when some badges have not been ordered and
forwarded. Arrangements have been made with the manufactur-
ing jeweler for converting the badge without bar into the badge
with bar, at a cost of $1.25, for adding the bar; and $3.50 for con-
verting the badge without bar into the badge with ribbon and bar,
these to be handled through this office. One badge has been con-
verted into; the badge with bar and ribbon.
The Second Vice-President-General has on hand a supply of
ribbons for badges, these can be supplied at a cost of 10 cents, for
sufficient for one badge, four of these have been sold.
Two bars for ex'-Presidents-General have been ordered, one for
the organization; and another was ordered through this office for
an ex-Presidentl-General who had lost her bar, cost $20.00.
Forty-nine United Daughters of the Confederacy medals have
been ordered, and badges sold as follows: received from Mrs. Ross,
ex-Second Vice-President-Creneral, December 2, 1924, badges with-
out bar, 18; badges with bar, 26; badges with ribbon, 10; from
Whitehead and Hoag, 2; badges without bar, 304; badges with bar,
50; badges with ribbon, 10. Total badges without bar, 322; with
bar, 76; with ribbon, 20.
We have sold badges without bar, 232; badges with bar, 49;
badges with ribbon, 12; and had on hand when the books closed
October 14th, 1925, 90 badges without bar. 27 badges with bar and
8 badges with ribbon. Amount received for medals, badges, rib-
bons, and ex-Presidents-General bar, $1874.04; of this amount
$1850 has been remitted the TreasuTer-General, leaving a balance
in First National Bank, Chatham, Va., $24.04.
The expenses of the office, consisting of postage, registry fee,
and express charges on badges received from jeweler have been
$57.10.
Respectfully submitted,
MAUDE BLAKE MERCHANT,
2nd Vicel-President-General.
Mrs. Merchant read the recommendation in her report,
which upon motion was adopted.
Owing to the increase in registry fee we recommend that the
amount of registry fee and postage on badges be increased from

ing Secretary-General, the Corresponding Secretary-General, the
Treasurer-General, the Historian-General, the Registrar-General,
and Custodian of Crosses," and inserting the words, "General
Officers of the organization" also, striking out the word "above"
in the sentence, "All expenses for above General Officers," so that

ing transportation, shall be paid, upon presentation of proper

ing expenses and hotel bill of the President-General shall be paid
to the annual Rel-unions of the United Confederate Veterans. All

Amend Article IV, Section 4, by striking out after the word esti-
mated (5th line) "and provided further that after the Convention
of 1920 every member so claimed.shall have been registered with
the Registrar-General" and inserting, "the Chapter has received
Chapter dues upon every member so claimed and provided further
that every member claimed shall have been registered with the
Registrar-General," so that the section as amended shall read:
"Each Chapter shall be entitled, in all Conventions of the United

members, and one vote for every additional twenty-five members,

## p. 132 (#136) ############################################

132 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
that the wording of her amendment was exactly like the
present By-Laws.
Mrs. McKinney, of Kentucky, spoke in favor of the
amendment, stating that chapters are carrying on their
rosters names of women who do not pay annual dues, and
when per capita tax time comes they pay it from their
Treasury fund instead of paying a certain percentage of
dues received from those members.
Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, asked if this amendment
would interfere with the right of a chapter to remit dues
of an active member who cannot afford to pay her dues.
The Chair ruled that it would.
The Treasurer-General quoted figures to show the dis-
crepancy between the number of members registered and
the moneys received as dues, and stated she thought
something should be done to remedy this condition so
that the actual number of active membership. could be
known.
After some discussion as to the wording of the amend-
ment should Mrs. Bashinsky's amendment be carried, the
Chair announced that this question would now be dis-
continued and the Convention would hear the result of
the vote for Honorary President.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 133
REPORT OF THIRD VICE-PRESIDENT-GENERAL
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
It is a great pleasure to bring to you cordial greetings from the
Children of the Confederacy and their Directors, and to express
to you their hope that this will be in all respects the greatest
General Convention ever held by the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy.
With this Convention the term of my office closes. The two
years of my administration have passed very quickly; the work
has kept me busy, and I have had little time to devote to other
matters. While the work has been exacting it has been a real
pleasure to me and I shall not soon forget the most pleasant re-
lations that have existed and still exist between my co-laborers
and myself. I have not reached the goal of my ambition, but I
am greatly encouraged at what has been accomplished and wish
for my successor a still greater increase in all phases of the Chil-
dren's work.
During the month of January, I mailed to each Director in the
General Division a sufficient number of the yearly program of
work, that each Chapter in the several Divisions could be supplied
therewith in order to familiarize them with the work to be done.
This I think is a great help.
It is impossible to give in detail all that has been done during
my incumbency, but I wish to give in brief some statistics as to
membership and enrollment of the General Division and also some
facts as to the several Divisions as follows:
Registered during the year 2957 new members, an increase over
last year of 219; total registration during my two years administra-
tion 5695; total enrollment 14960; active members 14061, 899 hav-
ing reached the age of eighteen years.
Organized 57 new Chapters this year as follows:
Alabama, 5; Arkansas, 6; California, 2; Florida, 3; Georgia, 5;
Louisiana, 2; Missouri, 1; Mississippi, 2; North Carolina, 10; Ohio,
1; Oklahoma, 1; South Carolina, 9; Texas, 1; Tennessee, 3; Virgi-
nia, 6. These added to the sixty new Chapters last year, making a
total of 345 Chapters of the Children of the Confederacy. I do
not wish to make my report tedious, but as this is the only means
of conveying the information relative to the work in the several
Divisions to the members of the Convention, I feel the work is of
such importance as to justify the necessity of giving the following
extracts from the reports of the Division Directors, viz:
Alabama Division, Mrs. Gustave F. Mertins, Director, has a mem-
bership of 645, enrolled 150 new mambersi this year, organized and
registered 5 new Chapters. Hold C. of C. Conference each June.
Best report, Dixie Eagles Chapter, Union Springs. Outstanding
work—Establishing a Scholarship named in honor of Ex-Regis-
trar to be known as the Gage Winston McMahon Scholarship.
Arkansas Division, Mrs. M. P. Myers, Director, has a membership
of 565, enrolled 275 new members this year, organized and reg-


## p. 134 (#138) ############################################

134 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
istered 6 new Chapters, three Chapters organized but papers not
received in time for registration. Best Chapter report, Randell
Chapter at Conway; Mrs. B. A. Mourning, Leader of Margaret Rose
Chapter, Little Rock, won the Minnie Falconer Membership Cup,
given for registering the greatest number of new members, (146).
All Chapters observe Memorial Days. Christmas boxes sent Con-
federate Home, valued at $25.00; birthday boxes to bedridden Vet-
erans, $15.00; outstanding work—enrolling members and studying
Southern History.
California Division, Mrs. Harry Graves, Director, has a mem.-
bership of 289, new members this year 91. Best report, Carroll
Loy Stewart Chapter at Alhambra. Organized and registered two
new chapters. Outstanding work—organization. Special effort to-
ward securing a C. of C. Chapter in every United Daughter of the
Confederacy Chapter in the Division. The Chapters have regular
monthly meetings with interesting programs, always something
historical and many of them have had essay contests during the
year. The special days observed by United Daughters of the Con-
federacy are also observed by the C. of C. $1080 donated to Jef-
ferson Davis and Woodrow Wilson Funds.
Florida Division, Miss William Eva Carruthers, Director, has a
membership of 661, enrolled 73 new members this year, organized
and registered 3 new Chapters. Best report this year, Annie Car-
ter Lee Chapter at Tampa. Hold C. of C. Conference during the

is given to C. of C. reports. Outstanding work—Educational and
caring for our men and women of the Sixties.
Georgia Division, Mrs. J. LeRoy Hankinson Director, has a mem-
bership of 1203, enrolled 190 new members this year, organized and
registered 5 new Chapters. The Thirteenth Annual Conference of
the Children of the Confederacy was held at Roberta, June 23,
24 and 25, 1925, with a very interesting program. Banners, medals,
loving cups and gold pieces were awarded in a number of con-
tests. The Children support the Mildred Rutherford Scholarship.
Outstanding work—.Helping the Veterans.
Illinois Division, Mrs. C. H. Cook, Director, has a membership of
30 members, 5 new members this year. The distances in Chicago
are so great the Children of the Chapter live so far apart, that
often it takes from one and one-half to two hours to go from. one
home to another and necessitates the parents accompanying their
children, so it is impossible to have meetings as frequently as
would be desired. The Illinois Division of the Daughters of the
Confederacy is composed of two Chapters, viz: Stonewall Chanter
and Chicago Chapter, both being in Chicago. The Children of Dix-
ie Chapter are sons and daughters of the members of these Chapi-
ters. A prize has been offered to the child who contribues the
best essay, showing the most knowledge and research on the lives
of the three Commanders—Lee, Maury and Jackson. It has been
the pleasure of the Children to send flowers to the sick, and the
desire of the Leader is to teach them "the joy of helping others"
that it is most blessed to give than to receive. The members of
the two ChaDtcrs co-operate beautifully in making Dixie a success.
Mrs. John C. Jacobs, President of the Division, has been most
kind in giving time and attention to the Children and she is award-

ship of 202, number1 of new members enrolled this year 39. "While
no new Chapters are reported, five will soon be ready for regis-
tration the coming year. The Director has not accomplished all
she would like to have, but nevertheless has been a splendid suc-
cess, and has left the work in fine condition for her successor.
During the two years of her administration she has registered five

ter having best report, A. J. Beale at Cynthiana. A part of the

book. Three Children kept from Chapter because they were great
nieces and great nephew connection. The Chapter voted and hopes
greatly the passing of the amendments submitted by the Director-
General. The following books are being, read by members of the
Chapter, "Life of Jefferson Davis and Heroes of 61." The Chap-
ter follows the program given in the Veteran in so far as the older
members can find the time in looking the references.
Missouri Division, Mrs. Geo. H. Baxter, Director, has a member-
ship of 123; new members enrolled this year, 21; one new Chapter

members, 63; new members enrolled this year, 7. Name of Chap-
ter sending best report, Joseph Wheeler. The difficulties of the
C. of C. work in New York City are almost insurmountable, yet,
they strive to keep alive in their children the "Spirit of the South,"
and to impress on them the correct history of the South. Meet-
ings are held with the Confederate- Veterans on Memorial Day,
and this year they celebrated "Newmarket Day."

Children claiming two for their grandmothers. This little act on
the part of the Children has brought happiness untold to these
Women in the Home.
Steel filing cases have been purchased for C. of C. Application
blanks, almost an exact duplicate of the cases in which United
Daughters of the Confederacy papers are filed. The outstanding
work has been educational, the Chapters manifesting an especial
interest in two scholarships, "The Tempe Whitehead Holt," and
"Nina Webb Wallace," maintained at Greensboro College and North
Carolina College for Women. These scholarships were awarded
the second year to the same two girls. The Chapters have over-
subscribed the required amount, leaving a balance in the Treasu-
ry, which enables this department to start a fund known as "The
C. of C. Scholarship Emergency Fund." Mrs. E. B. Glenn, of Ashe-
ville has established a scholarship through the C. of C. at the Uni>-
versity of North Carolina, known las the "Eugene Byron Glenn
Scholarship." It was awarded to a needy and worthy descendant of
a Confederate Veteran. It is valued at $200.00, making a total con-
tribution to the three scholarships $460.00. Contributions during
the year amount to $1580.05, besides many boxes and gifts sent
Confederate Homes-amounting to several hundred dollars in value.

at the entrance of the Confederate Woman's Home, Fayetteville,
N. C.

older girls aid in all things, collect money for the Philadelphia
United Daughters of the Confederacy, and all social entertainment

750 relics have been collected and placed in museums and libra-
ries. 15 Confederate flags and 11 pictures placed in schools. The

work is comparatively young in Virginia. A prize $10.00 is offer-
ed each year by' Mrs. Nixon, Director, known as "The Mary Spen-
cer Nixon Memorial Prize," to the Chapter registering the most
new members during the year, this was won by the Ninth of June
Chapter, her own, of which she was a charter member. One new
Chapter with 100 members ready to register, William Watts, Jr.,
of Roanoke. A beautiful idea in which the Children have indulg-
ed is the giving of Sunshine baskets to shutins. A gift for each
day, something useful. In one basket 65 days were covered, which
gave the greatest joy. As Director of the Virginia Division I want
to voice mv 'rv+ense interest in the adoption of the amendments
to the C. of C. Constitution.
West Virginia Division, Mrs. Chas. L. Reed, Director. Total num-
ber of members 98, new members enrolled this year 7. Several

of a Chapter of the Children of the Confederacy at Fargo, North
Dakota, in that the United Daughters of the Confederacy Chap-
ter there is growing and has application blanks and all informa-
tion as to organization of a Chapter, but thus far it has been im-
possible to do so. I hope however, the pleasure will come to my
successor.
By request of a number of Chapters I have submitted for adop-
tion three amendments to the C. of C. Constitution, as follows:
1st. Extending the age limit from eighteen to twenty one years.
2nd. Admitting nieces and nephews to the remotest degree.
3rd. Transferring members by demit to mother Chapter.

140 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
I now come to the last mile post in my journey as Director-
General of the Children's Chapters. I must confess there steals
over me a feeling of sadness, because of the love I have for the
work, as I lay dpwn this obligation. The office has been a signal
honor to me and one I greatly appreciate, but I do not value the
honor so much as I do the opportunity it has afforded for service,
and the one regret that I wish to express now is, that I have not
been able to accomplish more for the cause which lies so close
to my heart. Let me thank each and every one who has contribut-
ed to the success of my administration, and the Division as a whole
for honoring me with the office of Third Vice-President-General.
As an evidence of my continued love for the work I wish to
present to the General Organization a loving cup in honor of my
granddaughter to be known as, "The Grace Clare Taylor Loving
Cup," to be awarded each year to the Chapter of the Children of
the Confederacy registering the greatest number of new members
during the year.
Respectfully submitted,

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 143
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the United Confederate Veterans and Sons of Con-
federate Veterans are sponsoring a movement in the name of
"Southland Memorial Association," to establish an institute of
learning in some one of the Southern States, to be a beautiful and
worthy Memorial to the Women of the Confederacy, as a testimo-
nial of appreciation of the glorious devotion, heroism, and pa-
triotic sacrifice and service, these loyal women rendered the Con-
federate cause in the four long years of War of the Sixties;
WHEREAS, this "Southland Memorial University," to perpetuate
Southern ideals, and to teach the truth of Southern history to their
children's children of all the tomorrows, is a most fitting tribute
of honor and love to the noble women of the Confederacy.
THEREFORE, be it Resolved, that we, the United Daughters of
the Confederacy, in this Convention assembled, do most heartily
commend and encourage the veterans of the Southland Memorial
Association for this most laudible undertaking of theirs. With-
out, however, assuming any financial responsibility for same.
Respectfully submitted,
MRS. J. W. WILKINSON.
The preamble was then read and adopted.
Mrs. Grace, of Georgia, presented to the President-
General a basket of roses with the love of her Georgia
Division, Mrs. Harrold accepting them in words of deep-
est appreciation.
The Chair announced the report of the Confederate
Museum in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Miss Sally Archer
Anderson, Mrs. Charles E. Boiling read the following re-
port, which upon motion of Mrs. Lamar, was accepted
with the profound thanks of the assembly.
REPORT OF CONFEDERATE MUSEUM
Madam President-General United Daughters of the Confederacy:
I bring you greetings from the Confederate Memorial Literary
Society and a report from the Confederate Museum.
The past year has been encouraging and interesting in the Mu-
seum continues. In the year just completed more Life members
have been added to our membership than annual members. It is
gratifying to note the names of distinguished men from different
sections of the country who have become Life members. A few
of these are: Hon. Breckeriridge Long and Harrison Griswold


## p. 144 (#148) ############################################

144 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Dwight of Washington, D. C.; Charles Steele and J. Pierpont Mor-
gan of New York; Gamaliel Bradford of Massachusetts, and Gen-
eral William H. Cocke, Superintendent of the Virginia Military
Institute. Our youngest Life member is R. E. Lee, 4th, a little
baby, greatgrandson of our beloved Chieftain, General Robert E.
Lee.
The Confederate Memorial Literary Society had the pleasure
this year of bestowing Life memberships on three loyal and de-
voted members, namely: Miss Susan B. Harrison, who for 18 years
has faithfully served the Museum, first as Assistant House Regent,
and later as House Regent; Mrs. James R. Werth, one of the found-
ers of the Confederate Museum and for years the valued Chair-
man of the Sites Committee; and Mrs. James Dunlop also one of
the pioneers in the work of the Confederate Museum, and for
years the efficient Chairman of the Memorial Committee.
From November, 1924, to November, 1925, 9,132 pay visitors
registered, free visitors including delegates to the American His-
torical Association, visitors on Presidents Davis and Gen. Lee's
birthdays, school teachers and pupils numbered 1200, making a to1-
tal of 10,332 visitorsi registered during the year. The Endowment
Fund is growing slowly but surely, and I feel confident that in
time our goal of $200,000 (two hundred thousand dollars) will be
reached.
It is gratifying to note the interest of United Daughters of the
Confederacy Chapters in the Endowment Fund. Many Chapters
become Life members at $25.00, and one Chapter is a contributing
member at $10.00 annually. Recently R. E. Lee Chapter of the
Oranges, New Jersey, contributed $10.00 to the Endowment Fund,
and Stonewall Chapter, United Daughters of the Confederacy, of
Richmond, Virginia, gave $25.00 to this fund. I again recall to
your mind that Life membership fee of $25.00 always goes to the
Endowment Fund. Our beautiful Memorial book in which may
be inscribed the name and several lines of service or eulogy of
some loved one given as a memorial to the Endowfment Fund has
a great number of names already. This mode of giving "in Mc-
moriams" insures a permanent record in the Confederate Museum.
I have the honor to report 255 bound volumes of the "Roll of
Honor"—records of the Soldiers and Sailors of the Confederacy.
Too much attention cannot be given by the United Daughters of
the Confederacy of all States to this part of their work, for it is
due to the zeal of the Chapters that we have now 40,405 records
in bound volumes ably compiled by Mrs. James Dunlop, the valued
Chairman of the Memorial Committee. I urge each Daughter to
work to secure, and thus preserve the records of the gallant de-
fenders of States Rights in the War between the States. Some nec-
essary repairs and painting have been done in the Museum, the
former meeting room has been vacated in order to house relics,
and another room arranged for the meeting place.
The grounds of the Museum have been attractively planted with
flowering shrubs, box bushes, Iris and Ivy, which alreartv adds
much to the beauty of the place. Increasing work in the Museum

Thomas was appointed to the position and has proven the wisdom
of the selection.! She is at the Museum a half of each day.

For two months the Museum remained open on Saturday until
5 p. m. in order to give those employed during the week an op-
portunity to see this "vast treasure House." Few availed them-
selves of the privilege, therefore the regular closing hour, 2 p. m.,
was resumed. The Confederate Museum was represented at the
Southern Confederated Memorial Association meeting in Dallas,
Texas, and at all Confederate Memorial exercises in Richmond,
Virginia. A good number of the Stone Mountain Memorial coins
were sold by the Museum Committee. A year book was published
this year, and 600 copies were mailed, and many delivered per-
sonally.
Mr. John Wheeler Bennett, an interested English visitor to the
Confederate Museum, was the proud bearer to the British Museum,
London, of a replica of the Great Seal of the Confederacy, the gift
of Richmond Chapter United Daughters of the Confederacy,
through the generostiy of Mrs. Norman V. Randolph. The orig-
inal seal is in the Confederate Museum; and I quote the following
from Col. John Buchan's presentation speech printed in the Lon-
don Times:
"Last summer I had the privilege of visiting Richmond, and go-
ing over that wonderful Museum of War relics at the Confederate
House. It is a very remarkable Museum instituted in the days
of deep poverty by the exertion of the women of the South and
administered ever since by the voluntary work of the Confederate
Memorial Literary Society. It is amazingly complete, but I think
the most striking thing about it is its simplicity; the plain old
fashioned house, and the simple deal cases are to the visitor far
more impressive than any bronze or marble, for they are a proof
that in this War Memorial there is nothing formal or conventional.
It is not like so many memorials a mere casual recreation of wealth
but the gift of pure loyalty and affection, the evidence of an en-
during resolve not to let a great memory decay."
I am happy to record that the Battlefield of Second Cold Har-
bor has been marked with a tablet, the gift of the Confederate Me-
morial Literary Society placed by the Battlefield Markers Associa-
tion.
Time forbids a detailed record of the many interesting relics re-
ceived during the year. A few of these I will name:
A very handsome set of silver presented in 1873 to Mrs. R. Hop-
kins, a Virginian, by the Mobile Rifles of which Captain Rice Wil-
liams was commander, in recognition of her distinguished service
to the Confederate Cause. The State of Alabama sent Mrs. Hop-
kins to establish an Alabama Hospital in Richmond. She was
Wounded twice on the Battlefield of Seven Pines, helping to carry
wounded Alabama soldiers^ off the field. This silver is given by
Mrs. Juliet Opie Ayers who places it in the Virginia Room as a
memorial to her mother. This silver was sent first to the Con-
federate Memorial Institute (The Battle Abbey) but as they do
not receive such gifts they gave it to the Museum and Mrs. Ayers
requested the above disposition of it. Another interesting gift is
the beautiful portrait of Major John Pelham, given by the Alabama
Division to the Alabama Room. Also have been received field
glasses of General Beauregard, a set of chess made from bed slats
while the soldier was in prison, scroll made of wood and bronzed

with gilt letters from the Texas Division United Daughters of the
Confederacy, giving the names of Chapters contributing to the
University of Texas Scholarship Fund. An interesting scrap book
of War clippings in memory of Mrs. Anna Harrison Sulser. The
valuable collection of four pins worn by Mrs. Cornelia Branch
Stone while in office and bequeathed by her to the Texas Room.
They are Arlington Monument Association pin, a pin for work done
during the World War, pin Confederate Flag with her initial in
diamonds and her President-General's badge United Daughters of
the Confederacy. These pins have been mounted on blue velvet
and encased in a handsome mahogany frame. The collection of
dolls, an unending delight to our young visitors has been in-
creased by a delightful gentleman bearing the name of "General
Beauregard" and which Miss Anna Mayes of Hicksford, Virginia,
(now Emporia) used to carry through the streets calling her doll's
name which always infuriated the Yankee soldiers. A history of
Arkansas by Dr. J. H. Moore, Historian of Arkansas, is a valued
gift. A charming picture of Mrs. Jefferson Davis, taken in 1861,
has been received. A bass drum captured from a Southern Regi-
ment has been returned through the State Librarian of Connect-
icut.
We had the honor this year of welcoming to the Museum Prin-
cess de Polignac and her son. Pictures of Prince de Polignac and
one of the Princess and her son are appreciated gifts.
It gives me great pleasure to announce the recent appointment
of Mrs. Thomas Newbill of Nashville, Tenn., to serve as Regent
of the Tennessee Room.
I regret to record the death of Mrs. M. H. Cliff, former Regent
of Tennessee for the Confederate Museum, of Mrs. Decatur Axtell
many years ago Vice-Regent of Arkansas for the Confederate Mu-
seum, of General Chas. J. Anderson, a member of the Advisory
Board of the Confederate Museum, and of Mr. John Mason, who
until he left the city was also a member of this Board.
With the appreciation of the co-operation of my fellow workers
this report is respectfully submitted.

Mrs. Clay, of California, read a letter received from
Miss Elsie G. Johnston Pritchard, granddaughter of Gen-
eral Albert Sidney Johnston, and on her behalf presented
a locket containing the hair of Generals Lee and John-
ston, and moved that it be placed in the Richmond Mu-
seum; seconded by Mrs. Bagby and carried.
The President-General accepted the gift in words of
deep appreciation and asked Mrs. Clay to take back to
Miss Pritchard the thanks of the entire assembly.

After Texas and Kentucky made claims for the care
of the locket in their respective rooms, upon motion of
Mrs. Henderson, of Mississippi, seconded by Miss White,
of Tennessee, it was voted to place it in the Solid South
Room.
Miss West, of Texas, moved that with this memento
should be placed a copy of the Demetrie Tribute to Gen-
eral Albert Sidney Johnston, stating she felt sure some-
one, possibly Louisiana, would provide it. Carried.
Mrs. Boiling, of Virginia, thanked the Convention for
placing this precious memento in the Solid South Room.
The Treasurer-General, Mrs. Higgins, moved that the
amendment as prepared by Mrs. Woodliff affecting the
Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund be acted upon
immediately following the reading of that report.
Carried.
The Chair announced the reports of the Standing Com-
mittees in order.
The Chairman on History, Mrs. St. John A. Lawton,
read the following report, which upon motion was ac-
cepted:
REPORT OF THE HISTORY COMMITTEE U. D. C.
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
The combination or co-ordination of the three Committees in
this organization dealing with History, viz: the History Committee,
the Committee on "Southern Literature and Endorsement of Books,"
and the "Rutherford Committee," which was the result of the
recommendation offered by the History Committee in its report
read at the Savannah Convention last year, has worked very sat-
isfactorily, avoiding duplication and confusion.
Mrs. Lawton, Chairman of the History Committee, assigned to
the Division Historians the work of holding Historical Meetings;
of having historical addresses made in schools; of collecting rem-
iniscences of Confederate Veterans and women of the '60's; of
placing Confederate pictures and Confederate and State Flags in
schools; of placing books in libraries; collecting relics and writing
papers on Confederate subjects, etc.
Miss Elizabeth Hanna, Vice-Chairman of the Sub-Committee on
"Southern Literature and Endorsement of Books," urged her com-
mittee to make every effort to obtain old books, letters, and other


## p. 148 (#152) ############################################

148 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
documents of historical value, and especially as relating to Con-
federate history, to be placed in our own institutions of learning.
She likewise asked their help in locating and condemning books
unfair to the South; in correcting false statements; and especially
in placing in schools textbooks just to the South. Mrs. John Ander-
son, Vice-Chairman of the Sub-Committee known as "The Ruther-
ford Committee," with her Committee distributed throughout the
organization the H. Snowden Marshall Battle Abbey Address; Dr.
Scrugham's "Force or Consent as the Basis of American Govern-
ment," and the famous "Lee-Acton" Letters. These pamphlets
furnish material with which to refute the mythical and false teach-
ing so current today.
Thus- the work of the three Committees has been outlined, all
working along sympathetic lines, and all tending to the same ob-
jective, the Truth of History.
As to the Resolutions offered by Mrs. Weinmann of Arkansas
and embodied in the report of the History Committee in Savannah
that we have an Exhibit of Southern History in the New York
Exposition to be held early in the year 1925, the following is re-
ported:
At the breakfast of Historians held in Savannah, the matter as
to what form the exhibit should take, and many other matters per-
taining thereto, were discussed and it being impossible at that
time to arrive at any definite decision, the Chairman was authorized
to appoint a Sub-Committee to handle the matter. The following
Sub-Committee was appointed:
[Mrs. John F. Weinmann, of Arkansas.
Mrs. John L. Woodbury, of Kentucky.
Mrs. L. R. Schuyler, of New York.
Mrs. John W. Goodwin, of Pennsylvania.
Miss Annie Mann, of Virginia.
Mrs. Bennett D. Bell, of Tennessee.
Associated with the Committee were the Historian-in-Chief of
the Sons, Arthur H. Jennings, to whom is due having suggested
that some kind of History Exhibit be showft at the Exhibition,
and Dr. Matthew Page Andrews, who attended the breakfast and
kindly offered to go to New York and look over the grounds and
see what could be done.
This offer of Dr. Andrews was most gratefully accepted by the
Committee.
The great scheme of the Mechanical Book, moving constantly by
electricity and showing pages of Southern History, presented itself
to Dr. Andrews and he went to much trouble to get bids for cost
of construction and in ascertaining the cost of space in the Build-
ing and in looking into the matter of cost of making pictures by
which the History was to be shown.
After hearing from the Committee, each expressing approval of
the plan, and of our going into it at a cost of approximately
-..


## p. 149 (#153) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 149
$2,500.00, the Chairman authorized Dr. Andrews to secure space
and to proceed with the Book.
Rapidly the expenses increased until the cost seemed to ap-
proach $5,000.00 and upward. It was then deemed necessary to
confer with the President-General and the Treasury-General as
to the funds available and the wisdom of further action. While
each member of the Committee had approved the very original
and brilliant plan of showing the history, still no member had
suggested any way by which the necessary money could be raised
and as it was necessary to make cash payments to New York work-
men and producers, and it also being found necessary to make
decisions with great haste in view of the fact that the Exposition
was practically at hand; the Chairman and the President-General
both felt the necessity for cautious action, since in the Treasury
for all purposes was only $2,000.00.
Therefore, after much correspondence between Dr. Andrews and
the Chairman, it was found necessary for the United Daughters of
-the Confederacy to withdraw from the project because of insuf-
ficient funds.
This action was taken with most profound regret but it was un-
avoidable.
Dr. Andrews was most considerate and not only allowed us to
sever our connection with the plan, but presented no bill for his
New York expenses.
We are under a debt of gratitude to him for his great considera-
tion.
For the honor of our organization, let it be very definitely under-
stood that at no time did we feel that we were deserting a sinking
ship or leaving our friend, Dr. Andrews, in an embarrassing posi-
tion financially. He had never for an instant questioned the ulti-
mate success of the Book, and he regretted that we had to give up
the plan when he believed we could realize money therefrom after
the Exposition was over. He advocated getting the co-operation of
certain individuals and Chambers of Commerce to finance the
scheme and he never for a moment weakened in his faith in the
enterprise.
It was most gratifying to realize that it was most successful in
getting the financial aid of these individuals or bodies and made
a tremendous success of the Biggest Book in the World.
Nothing shows us more decidedly the great need the United
Daughters of the Confederacy has for the Historical Foundation
of thirty thousand dollars which was authorized last year, than
our failure to grasp such opportunities as this for putting our
History before the world, which for lack of funds we have to
see go by.

Mrs. Lanier, of Connecticut, stated that a book en-
dorsed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, at
Savannah, had been removed from the shelves of the
Southern Exposition, May, 1914, and asked re-endorse-
ment of the book at this time, but yielded the floor for
the reading of the report on endorsement of books.
In the absence of the Vice-Chairman, Miss Elizabeth
Hanna, the Historian-General, Mrs. Lawton, read the re-
port on Southern Literature and Endorsement of Books,
which upon motion was accepted without its recom-
mendations:
REPORT OF THE VICE-CHAIRMAN
Southern Literature and Endorsement of Text-books.
At a meeting of the Text-book Committee of the Atlanta Board
of Education held April 18, against the protest of the minority, and
in spite of an earnest appeal from the chair, seven of the members
(a majority of one) voted to adopt for use in the junior high school
Wilbur F. Gordy's History of the United States. The Sons of
Veterans, represented ably by Mr. John Ashley Jones, has made a
strong fight against this adoption,—so far I regret to say ineffect-
ual. In the effort to keep this most unfair book out of our schools,
the Chairman took an active part, aiding Mr. Jones in every pos-
sible way.
Added to the influx of northern men into our cities, we have a
large class of citizens ignorant of the history of their own section,
and too indifferent to learn, and we have a class of would-be
progressives, who think that progress and broad-mindedness con-
sists in suppressing any southern sympathies they may have, and
falling into line with northern new-comers.
The publishers of this book claim to have made corrections.
But why should we adopt a doctored Northern history, which
perhaps has one set of histories for the South, and another for
the North, and turn down good books offered by Southern writers,
and Southern Publishing houses? We seem to advocate encourag-
ing home industries for everything except literature, and then we
talk about backwardness of the South. Let us make no mistake.
The South is a wonderful field of exploitation for Northern Pub-
lishing houses, and they will spare no efforts to absorb it.
In my last report I called attention to the college entrance re-
quirements of the New England, Middle and Southern Association
of Secondary schools whose curriculum ignores all Southern
authors except Edgar Allen Poe, and includes an alarming Lincoln
propaganda. There are no doubt other such associations whose
course of study is equally neglectful of the South. Let us keep
in mind that secondary schools must belong to one or the other
of these associations, and observe their requirements, and we will
understand how the education of our young people is being taken
\

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 151
out of our hands, and why they are drifting away from the teachl-
ings and records of the past; for these courses of study are all
arranged without regard the needs of the South, and in direct
opposition to all we stand for.
Shall we still continue blind to these conditions, or shall we
take some steps to correct them?
The Chairman has carefully reviewed Gordy's History of the
United States; a History of America by Carl Russell Fish; Con-
federate Portraits and Robert E. Lee, the American, by Gamaliel
Bradford; also Robert E. Lee, the Soldier, by Gen. Sir Frederick
Maurice.
The History by Carl Russell Fish is written in a kindly spirit,
with the evident desire to write a history which will not offend
the sensibilities and prejudices of either section. In the effort to
do this he deals in a cursory way with the most important epochs
in American history; still the book is so full of valuable informa-
tion not often found in school histories, on economic and political
questions, and on the evolution of this government, that it will be
found of great value as a supplementary text-book on history.
The Chairman succumbed to the charm of diction and the sym-
pathetic spirit in which Gamaleil Bradford's books are written,
and bought both for the use of foreign libraries. She is no judge
of the value of Sir Frederick Maurice's exposition of Lee's Cam-
paigns, but she finds the book marred by statements regarding
Lee's attitude of mind at the close of the "War Between the
States," I and an intimation that in his "heart of hearts" he re-
gretted the course he had taken. This is so far from what we know
to be true, that the book seems not available in our library work.
Mrs. Woodbury of Louisville and Mrs. John Earle Lewis of
Cornelia, Ga., have offered to the Committee book plates of very
artistic design. The question of a choice has been submitted to
the Committee.
The Chairman feels that the Foreign Library work is now of
sufficient importance to warrant the use of a handsomer book
plate than the one that has been in use, and recommends that one
be adopted.
The Chairman is looking forward to the issuing from the press
of a second edition of Dr. MdGehee's valuable work, "Causes which
led to the War Between the States," and the revised edition of
Horton's Youth's History of the Great Civil War. The latter is a
colaboration by Miss Mary D. Carter and Loyd T. Everitt.
The Chairman begs to call attention to her letter on Foreign
Libraries, published in the September Veteran nad asks the help
of the Daughters in sending to the American Library in Paris the
following books and-publications:
Jefferson Davis, Constitutionalist, His Letters and His Speeches,
by Dr. Dunbar Roland.
The complete files of the Louisiana Historical Quarterly
A set of the Virginia Historical Collection, or at least the one
relating to the Huguenot Settlement in Virginia.

152 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The 17th volume of the Library of Southern Literature.
For the first time in the course of its endeavors this Committee
sent a gift of valuable books to the Washington and Lee University.
These were gratefully received. It is up to us to equip the library
of that institution so that the Ph. D. degree in history can be given
to its students.
Later, the Texas Division, through its very efficient Chairman,
Mrs. W. E. Langston, sent the Chairman a check for $75.00 to pur-
chase Dr. Dunbar Roland's book to be sent as their gift to the
American Library in Paris. The check came too late to be entered
on the books of the Treasurer-General and he used for the purpose
stated until after the meeting of the General Convention in Novem-
ber. Dr. Dunbar Roland, being notified of the necessary delay in
this purchase, has sent these books to the Chairman, waiving pay-
ment until later.
A letter from the Meridian Chapter United Daughters of the
Confederacy, calling attention to remarks unfair to President Davis
in the biographical sketch of Governor Henry S. Wise, was en-
closed to the publishers of the Library of Southern Literature, with
a request that they give the matter their attention, and in their
next edition, omit these objectionable opinions, in view of the fact
that a better knowledge of events, is Riving Mr. Davis his proper
place in history, and in the hearts of his countrymen.
The Chairman has sent books to the Dulaney Memorial Collection
at Ottawa; to the American Library in Paris; to the Washington
and Lee University at Lexington. A letter from the Librarian of
the Bodleian was received too late to be acted upon before the
General Convention. It concerned a fine list of books offered to
them through the Chairman for Tennessee, Miss Kavanaugh, and
which was accepted with thanks. The Chairman thanks the mem-
bers of her Committee for their cordial and most efficient support.
She feels that any success we have had is largely due to them.
Recommendations.
The Chairman recommends, That a more elaborate book plate
be selected for use in the Foreign Library work.
She recommends and begs that in view of the dangers threaten-
ing our schools, a Committee of our most capable and wisest
daughters be appointed to consider the text-book situation in our
educational institutions and especially in .our secondary schools,
and to devise some way to meet it.

She recommends and begs that in view of the dangers threaten-

and to devise some way to meet it.
The Corresponding Secretary-General read the Rules
and Regulations in re time limit prescribed for reports,
and the Chair announced the appointment of Miss Daf-
fan as Timekeeper.
Mrs. John Anderson, Vice-Chairman, read the report
of the Rutherford History Committee, which after re-
quests for changes in references therein citing the War
Retween the States, under different names, was accepted.
THE REPORT OF THE RUTHERFORD HISTORY COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
We Daughters of the Confederacy who are working directly
under the Historical Department, feel that it is our sacred duty
to "Keep History Straight" and to record the truth about our be-
loved Southland, bearing always in mind the motto of the Historical
Department, "Loyalty to the truth of Confederate History."
The Rutherford History Committee, now a sub-committee under
the History Committee (of which our Historian-General is Chair-
man), is endeavoring to disseminate literature that will educate
the students of America in the truth of Southern History. A similar
committee of the United Confederate Veterans under General Irvine
Walker and the Sons of Veterans, with Mr. A. H. Jennings as His-
torian, are following the same lines, and through these channels,
as well as a committee on Southern literature and text-books, and
the General History Committee composed of Division Historians,
many errors have been corrected. These committees cannot do

all, but each Daughter of the Confederacy may help by using her
influence in her own community.
The special work of the Rutherford History Committee of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy for .the past year has been
an intensive campaign (approved by our Historian-General, Mrs.
Lawton), of pamphlets through which we feel much good has been
accomplished.
In order to refute propaganda which is being taught in the
schools of our Southland, our committee sent out 100 copies al-
together of the following pamphlets to the Division Presidents and
Historians for them in turn to have published and distributed
through the organization: "Battle Abbey Address" by Hon. H.
Snowden Marshall (Confederate Memorial Institution, Richmond).
"Force or Consent as a basis of the American Government" by
Dr. Mary Scrugham (Lexington, Kentucky). "General Lee's letter
to Lord Acton of England." "H. Snowden Marshall's Address"
is one of the most convincing and able presentations of this sub-
ject, written by a lawyer of national repute. Dr. Scrugham's
article comes to us with the endorsement of one of the largest
Northern universities, it being said by the Columbia History Com-
mittee to be the ablest presentation of the position of the South
they had ever read.
We have urged every Division to have the Lee-Acton letter
read on every January 19th, especially in the schools, and to have
it published in the local papers.
This Committee has also recently sent to the Division Historians
copies of the pamphleft "Jefferson Davis' Rightful Place in. History"
by Dr. D. A. Long. Also have sent copies to universities and libra-
ries throughout the South. This pamphlet has received the en-
dorsement of the Rutherford Committee of the United Sons of
Confederate Veterans Organization, through its Historian in Chief,
Mr. A. H. Jennings; and of the North Carolina State Board of
Education, and it has been placed in the schools of that State. A
review of it by Mr. A. H. Jennings appeared in the August Con-
federate Veteran. We are hoping that Dr. Long's pamphlet will
be used in our Jefferson Davis Memorial Services; read by our
members, and, later put in schools of all the Southern States.
Letters have been received from many of our Division Historians,
testifying their deep interest in this matter and promising their
co-operation in bringing about these ends. Letters from colleges
and librarians express great appreciation of these pamphlets and
promise to use them with their students.
Captain S. A. Ashe of North Carolina has made a review of Dr.
Mary Scrugham's address for our Committee, which we had mim-
eographed for distribution to the Divisions.
Miss Mildred Rutherford of Georgia, generously gave hundreds
of her valuable "scrap books" of Confederate History to this Com-
mittee, to be sent throughout the country to teach the truth of the
South.
Through permission of .the author, Professor Archibald Rutledge,
the article on "Lincoln from a Southern Viewpoint" has just been
published in pamphlet form by the North Carolina Division. We
feel that the present day tendency to make a demigod of Lincoln

may be refuted by information such as this article contains. Above
all sources of assistance in our work is the "Confederate Veteran"
through whose columns a warfare for the truth of Southern History
is always being waged.
General Irvine Walker, Chairman of the Rutherford History
Committee of the United Confederate Veterans Association, has
given valuable advice and co-operation to this Committee of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy. This eminent Historian has
thus expressed his views on our responsibility in a recent letter to
me; "The highest duty of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
and the other Confederate organizations in my humble judgment,
is to establish the truth, and we can only re-establish it by
boldly asserting it. The victor always writes the history, and the
History of the Confederate War has been so written, without
regard to the truth." General Walker commends the Southern
Publishing Company of Dallas, Texas, for their fine wiork in pub-
lishing Southern Histories. Their Hall, Smither and Ousley History
of the United States is one of the fairest and most teachable.
Mr. Arthur H. Jennings, Historian-in-Chief of the Sons of Con-
federate Veterans, writes us that he is co-operating with the work
of the Rutherford History Committee all the time, and we know
what a wonderful ally the United Daughters of the Confederacy
has in this lover of the South. In his report to the Sons of the
Confederate Veterans Convention last May, Mr. Jennings specifically
mentioned the reading of the Lee-Acton letter on all Memorial
occasions. Mr. Jennings has aided our cause greatly in his reviews
through the "Veteran," of books and pamphlets on Confederate
subjects.
As Chairman of this Committee I have given a great deal of time
to this work and hundreds of letters have been written in the
interest of it. Our Committee only asks for Histories fair to all
sections. Walter Hines Page told his Northern friends that they
were ignorant of the South. Why is that true? Because the
Northern school books are deficient in matters relating to the
South. In a hand book recently sent out by a Chicago firm of
"Choice Addresses and Declamations of America," there is not one
from a Southern man! Think of this, Daughters, when we have
had the most wonderful orators that the Nation has produced and
such speeches as Henry Grady's "Old and New South" and Jef-
ferson Davis' "Farewell to the U. S. Senate," besides those of
Calhoun and hundreds of others we could name, stand out as
superb specimens of oratory. A prominent educator said to me
recently that it would go down in history (not his opinion, how-
ever) that the South was wrong in the War Between the States.
Are we to let such an untruth be believed by our descendants?
The offer of a prize in this Historian,jGeneral's list for best His-
torical work done for the schools has been an incentive to our
members in making talks to students on phases of Southern History'
and has brought about a more intelligent study of this History.
Another prize offered in the Historical list has called forth diligent
research in preparing a list of valuable books on Confederate
History.
We have placed many of Miss Rutherford's books on "The Truth
in History and Literature" in schools and book clubs. Our en-
deavors have met with good results in placing Southern book

shelves in schools and also in establishing a Southern Poet's Day
through the English classes. We have tried to vindicate the liter-
ary culture of the South by urging this study of Southern litera-
ture, to which too little attention has been paid. Many visits have
been made the libraries, colleges, State Departments of Education,
and we have attended meetings of the State Educational Associa-
tion in the interest of our work.
Opportunities for doing still better work are opening up before
us for the coming year, still more widely placing the pamphlets
which we have been distributing, and others that are coming from
the press right along, among them being a revised and amplified
edition of a treatise on the "Causes of Secession" by Hon. J. J.
McSwain of South Carolina, that has already won nation-wide
reputation among teachers of history.
A contribution to our study of Confederate History (just com-
ing from the press) is a reprint edition of "Horton's Youth's His-
tory of the Great Civil War," being published by the Southern
Publishing Company of Dallas, Texas. It will come out with his-
tory notes, prepared by Lloyd T. Everett, author of "Living Con-
federate Principles," and a several page key-word to the revised
edition. This work was originally written by Rushmore G. Hor-
ton, of New York, in 1866. Miss Mary D. Carter of Virginia, a
member of this Committee, is co-editor of this history with L. C.
Everett.
A prize of $25.00 is offered for the coming year, by a member
of our Rutherford History Committee, for the best essay written
on these books which we have sent out: "Force or Consent as
the Basis of American Government," by Dr. Mary Scrugham;
"The Battle Abbey Address" by H. S. Marshall; "Jefferson Davis"
by Dr. D. A. Long; The Lee-Acton Letter, revised edition of Hor-
ton's History, by Southern Publishing Company of Dallas, Texas.
Richard H. Edmunds, Editor of the Manufacturers Record, has
been of invaluable aid in publishing in this business man's mag-
azine articles on our Confederate History.
The co-operation of newspapers have resulted in emphasizing
Confederate anniversaries and in publishing Historical articles.
As Chairman, I have had the support of each one of the splendid
w;omen of this Committee and each has endeavored in her Division
to carry on the work as planned. Always we ha"ve sought counsel
of our Historian-General, under whom we function, and have had
the encouragement of our President-General in our work. We feel
that much success has crowned our efforts this year. Miss Ruther-
ford in commending the literature which we have sent out says,
"Progress is being made toward the truths of Southern History,
I can feel it. I am so glad to see the work of this energetic Com-
mittee." The great need in this department of our organization
is the co-operation of every Daughter of the Confederacy, for the
cause is so vital that the wholehearted service of every Southerner
should be given. The eyes of the Nation are strongly centered on
our Southland in a material way, and the time is at hand for us
to renew our efforts for the truths of our history.
May we ever remember the words of our Chieftain Lee when he
said, "Every man should do all in his power to disseminate the
truth, in the hope that it may find a place in history and descend
to posterity."

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1925
Afternoon Meeting
The afternoon meeting was called to order at 2:15 by
the President-General, Mrs. Harrold.
The Chair announced the report of the Committee on
Education in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Mrs. T. T. Stevens,
Mrs. Cabell Smith, of North Carolina, read the report of
the Committee on Education, also the reports of the
Woodrow Wilson Scholarship Fund and Cornelia Branch
Stone Scholarship Fund reports, which reports after cor-
rection were accepted:
REPORT OP COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
Your Committee on Education has been actively at work since
early in the year distributing literature and answering inquiries
concerning scholarships.
The Lee Memorial Scholarship at Washington and Lee University
being vacant this year has made the work much heavier than last
year, as inquiries and applications have poured in from all over
the country, for this and the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship.
The Mary B. Poppenheim Scholarship at Vassar College and the
Lee Memorial Scholarship still lead in interest among our appli-
cants, which attests the popularity of these Full Scholarships, and
gives evidence of their value to our needy students.
The splendid committee appointed by our President-General to
serve with your Chairman of Education, Mrs. J. C. Muse, Texas,
Mrs. B. B. Ross, Alabama, Mrs. Cabell Smith, North Carolina, and
Mrs. Hugh Miller, Missouri, are women outstanding in our organ-
ization and are ever ready to assist in the work whenever needed.
With a deep sense of appreciation, your Chairman expresses
thanks to the Division Chairman for their untiring effort in behalf
of students from their respective Slates who are beneficiaries of
the General United Daughters of the Confederacy.
In many instances where application has been made for a loan
or Gift Scholarship, the Division Chairman has put her shoulder to

the wheel and has helped the student when there were no funds
available in the General United Daughters of the Confederacy
Treasury, thus assuming individual responsibility towards their
own students who were seeking financial aid.
Communications have gone to every holder of a scholarship and
to all applicants, to the Colleges attended by the students, to the
Division Chairmen of Education and to the Chairmen of the
WoodroW Wilson Memorial Scholarship Fund, and to many other
people interested in education. In all. approximately twelve hun-
dred letters and cards have been written, besides numerous tele-
grams sent in circumstances where immediate answer was re-
quired.
The scholarships and loans herein listed constitute a record of
which any organization would justly be proud.
Full Scholarships Covering Tuition and Board
1. Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship. The Woodrow Wil-
son Scholarship was established at the last Convention in memory
of our World War President, in the Law school at the University
of Virginia, the Alma Mater of President Woodrow Wilson. This
scholarship has been awarded to Mr. J. Summerfield Andrews of
Roanoke, Va. Mr. Andrews was highly recommended by Dean
Page of the University of Virginia, this recommendation being
supported by numerous letters of the most sterling quality.
In a manly letter of thanks to this committee, Mr. Andrews
states, "I am honored to be selected as the first one to hold the
Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship, and I shall bend every
effort to follow in the footsteps of that learned man, with the
desire in my heart to be a credit to the University of Virginia,
to my State and to my Country. I hope to establish such a cred-
itable record that those who receive the scholarship after me
will have to give of their best to maintain my standard."
The Woodrow Wilson Scholarship at the time of award, having
such a small amount to draw upon, the committee gave to Mr.
Andrews a loan of $100 from the Virginia Hero Loan Fund, so that
he could begin his school year unhampered.
A late letter from the Bursar of the University states that Mr.
Fred W. Scott of Richmond, Va., has generously agreed to guarantee
to Mr. Andrews $500 towards his expenses.
2. Mary B. Poppenheim Scholarship at Vassar College, Pough-
keepsie, N. Y. Value $800.00. This scholarship was held during
the school year of 1924-25, by Miss Eleanor Phelps of Fort Worth,
Texas. The hearty endorsement of the Dean of Vassar, together
with glowing reports during the year commended the re-appoint-
ment of Miss Phelps.
3. Washington and Lee Memorial Scholarship, at Washington
and Lee University, Lexington, Va., value $500. Many applications
were received for this scholarship, but the unusually fine letters
of endorsement influenced the Committee to choose Robert Bryarlv
Lee, of Bel Air, Maryland.
In a letter of appreciation to the Committee Mr. Lee writes, "You
may observe that my application was not based upon my connect

tion with General Lee, although several wanted me to stress it.
However, I did not mention it, as I wished to receive the award
on the service of my own father who left his own State to cast
his lot with Virginia, and fought for those rights which had char-
acterized his ancestors for several generations. My ovrti ambition
is to live up to the character and traditions of the family to' which
I belong."

Special Resolution
On January 13, 1925, the Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter passed
the following resolution:
Whereas, There is now awaiting adoption or rejection by the
States what would be the twentieth amendment to the Constitution
of the United States, called the child labor amendment; and,
Whereas, This amendment is an attempt to substitute for the
theory of the right of the States, the nationalization of the youth
of this country, and this is a Socialistic idea; and,
Whereas, The adoption of this amendment would be one more
piece of legislation to increase the centralization of all the powers
of the Government;
Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the members of the Albert Sidney
Johnston Chapter No. 120, United Daughters of the Confederacy,
go on record as opposed to this amendment. That We call the
attention of the United Daughters of the Confederacy generally
to this attack on one of the fundamental principles of our Govern-
ment. That we request our Representatives in the Kentucky Gen-
eral Assembly of 1926 to reject this measure. That a copy of
these resolutions be spread upon our minutes and a copy be fur-
nished to the press of our city. These resolutions were the subject
of an editorial highly commending them, entitled "Women Who
Think."

Memorial as soon as possible, your Chairman of Education urges
that this Scholarship be pushed to completion as soon as possible
to show to the world the love and esteem our organization holds
for the great War President, also to provide the necessary funds
for the worthy student who is awarded this scholarship in the
Law School of the University of Virginia.
The second recommendation was then read, and upon
request of Mrs. Smith was withdrawn.
After several requests to make corrections in the re-
port on Education, Miss Poppenheim moved that the
Convention give authority to those Divisions finding er-
rors to send such corrections to the acting chairman who
made the report and that she be allowed to append same
to Her report as addenda reported at this Convention.
Carried.
After some further discussion as to the advisability of
correcting reports in connection with contributions to
the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship, Mrs. Higgins moved
that the Treasurer-General submit for incorporation in
the minutes of this Convention a list of all moneys on
hand for the various funds at the closing session of this
Convention. Carried.
The Second Vice-President-General, Mrs. W. C. N.
Merchant, was called to the Chair at this point.

Committee on Transportation, which upon motion of
Mrs. Byrne was accepted with a rising vote of thanks.
REPORT OF TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE
Hot Springs National Park, Ark.,
Nov. 20, 1925
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
On April 24th, I made formal application to Mr. J. E. Hannegan,
Chairman Southwestern Passenger Association, St. Louis, Mo., for
reduced rates from all points in the United States to Hot Springs,
Ark., on the Identification Certificate Plan, for the meeting of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy.


## p. 175 (#179) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 175
I regret to advise that my application was declined and sugges-
tion was made that rates on the Straight Certificate Plan would
prevail, which would have made it necessary for each member to
purchase a one-way railroad ticket, taking receipt for fare paid
and if there were as many as 250 members in attendance holding
receipts, tickets wtould have been sold from Hot Springs returning
home at one-half of the fare paid for the going trip.
Your Chairman wrote Mr. Hannegan that we were unwilling to
accept the plan suggested and insisted that he grant us rates on
the Identification Certificate Plan, as we were entitled to such
rates on account of haying had more than 250 members in attend-
ance and who had purchased railroad tickets to our meetings held
in Birmingham, Washington and Savannah and the Southeastern
lines had granted us rates on the Identificattion Certificate Plan.
I also stated that unless the Southwestern lines granted us the same
consideration, I did not think our organization could very consist-
ently consider holding our meeting in the Southwestern Passenger
Association territory again.
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that after further cor-
respondence with Mr. Hannegan he very kindly granted us reduced
rates as requested and I wish to take this opportunity of thanking
him through our organization.
I immediately ordered two thousand Identification Certificates,
and when received I distributed them to our President, General
Officers, and Division Presidents.
Under date of Aug. 25th, I issued transportation order quoting
service and routes of special Pullmans from various points to Hot
Springs, sending same to Division Presidents and others, writing
each one calling attention to this special service and stating that I
would be pleased to have them use this service wherever prac-
ticable.
Your Chairman is grateful to note, that passenger representa-
tives of the lines over which our special Pullmans were routed
have assisted her in every way possible and she wishes to take this
opportunity of thanking them for their assistance.
Respectfully submitted,
SUSIE JEFFERSON ALLEN,
(Mrs. Walter)
Chairman Transportation Committee U. D. C.
Mrs. Wilkins, of Washington, moved that the Transpor-
tation Committee be instructed to try to secure a special
railroad rate to the Convention West of Chicago and the
Mississippi, extending for a duration of time not less
than six weeks, and if possible two months. Carried.
Mrs. Allen explained the difficulties encountered in
obtaining rates, and expressed the hope that in the fu-
ture even better rates would be secured.


## p. 176 (#180) ############################################

176 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The Chair announced the report of the Mrs. Norman
V. Randolph Relief Fund for Needy Confederate Women
in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Mrs. Amos Norris, the
Treasurer-General, Mrs. Higgins, read the following re-
port, which upon motion was accepted with thanks with-
out its recommendations.
REPORT MRS. NORMAN V. RANDOLPH RELIEF FUND
Madam President-General and Members of the Convention:
It is with genuine sorrow that I am again having to ask my
friend, Mrs. J. P. Higgins, to read this report for me instead of
being able to give it to you myself. But business matters that
need my attention have kept me at home this year. I hope this
will be the last time that I will have to be reported absent.
The work of this Committee the past year has shown a decided
increase. As I reported to you a year ago we had twenty persons
on our roll. When the Treasurer-General's books closed thirty
days ago we had twenty-eight. Since that time another application
has been signed by your Chairman, and a second application sent
to an applicant in Missouri, so by the close of this Convention we
will have thirty pensioners against twenty a year ago. The Death
Angel has invaded this circle and carried away two members in
the past year. Again I am able to report that the Committee has
been able to grant assistance to every applicant, which I know will
be gratifying to you. By your interest and your generosity you
have made this possible.
When the Treasurer-General's books closed they showed total
receipts for this fund this year to be $4,635.05,—expenditures
$4,356.50. So you see we have just $278.55 to meet the December
checks. Then I am sure you will vote at this Convention to send
the annual offering of five dollars at Christmas time to every
pensioner, which will take an additional $140.00. The amount
necessary to meet the December payments and the Christmas fund
is $560.00. We have on hand only $278.55. Therefore we are
short $281.45 to meet it. I hope that the contributions on the floor
of this Convention will make up this deficit.
It is hard to say this year whether all Divisions have paid their
quota or not, as our original quota was $1.00 per Chapter. The
last Convention requested them to pay $5.00 instead of $1.00. You
have done well with this fund. I am sure you are deeply interested
in it, and I wiant to thank each Division Chairman for this co-
operation, and their interest.
A letter was sent to each Division Director early in the year with
suggestions for the work in her State. In August a second letter
was sent to each giving the amount paid in up to that date by
their State and giving the amount of pledges made at the Savannah
Convention, and requesting that they see these pledges were re-
deemed at once.
-.


## p. 177 (#181) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 177
As we stated in our last report some other means must be devised
to take care of the increasing demand on this fund. To this end
the Treasurer-General offered a prize to the Division sending in
the best plan for raising this fund. The Chairman of this Fund
believes that the plan submitted by our Registrar-JGeneral, Mrs.
Woodliff, is the best and she sincerely hopes that the proposed
revision in the by-laws raising the per capita tax from twenty to
thirty-five cents, giving the additional raise of fifteen cents for
relief work will be carried at this Convention, as that is the only
way to make every member assume her share of the responsibility.
And it is marvelous how much interest fifteen cents will buy in a
thing—then every woman will have fifteen cents worth of interest
in our needy Women. Mrs. Woodliff reports that there are 65,000
paying members of the organization, and at fifteen cents per capita
it would produce a fund of $9,750.00. As we expended $4,356.50
this year, it would give us an increase for next year's work of
$5,393.50—ample I believe for some years to come.
I am sure you are deeply interested in the people we are help-
ing, and I want to give you the contents of a letter which came
to me recently. The recipient's application was presented by the
President of the Maryland Division, Mrs. Canby. When she wrote
us of this old lady's needs, and that she had no nourishing food
to eat, and asked if it was possible to help her, -we replied of course
we could. The application was sent because it is for such as these
you contribute, and the Maryland Division particularly has been
most generous in its contribution, having given $273.00 to this fund
in the past year. This is the grateful letter Mrs. Bowling has just
written:
"Words are inadequate to express my gratitude at receiving
the second check so soon, and I write to return many many
grateful thanks for the same. By the kindness of the Daughters
of the Confederacy I will have many comforts this winter
which I could not have afforded otherwise. Their noble act
of affection toward a helpless widow of an ex-Confederate
officer will be remembered during my life, and if such a thing
is possible my feelings of devotion and kinship to you and the
Daughters will extend beyond the grave.
"My life has been a sad one, having lost my mother when
only five years old. Consequently I was deprived of one of
the greatest blessings—a mother's love. Yet I can't complain
for my faith is the common faith of all—'Into each life some
rain must fall. Some days must be dark and dreary.' Now in
my declining years, years which have been filled with poverty,
to have such kindness shown me by the generous Daughters,
seems like a dream.
"Will now conclude with best wishes for your dear self and
all the Daughters, I am,
Sincerely and gratefully yours,
Mrs. FRANK W. BOWLING."
I am sure you will be most happy to know that your money has
brought sunshine into her life.


## p. 178 (#182) ############################################

178 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
And now there is another case that is weighing heavily on my
heart—that of Mrs. Louise Summers, another pensioner in Detroit,
Michigan. In a recent letter she gave a new address and she said:
"This is the fifth time I have moved in a year on account of
constantly increasing rent. The cheapest I can now rent a
room in a decent neighborhood is $25.00 per month. Why
don't the Daughters of the Confederacy put me in a home some-
where. Oh! I do so want a home. I am so tired of moving."
That cry has so wrung my heart that I have written a letter,
copy of which I am enclosing to you, to the Board of Management
of our beautiful Old People's Home at Tampa, which is intended
only for residents of this County, and I am asking them to make
an exception of this case, and admit her as a life member into the
Home. Three hundred dollars will pay for this life membership,
which will take care of her as long as she lives and provide a decent
burial in a beautiful plot they own in the cemetery here. It would
take another hundred dollars to bring her to Tampa and provide
her with necessary clothing. They are to act on this application
at their Board meeting Wednesday, November 18th, and if it is
favorable I wfill wire Mrs. Higgins, and I will be one of forty
women to contribute ten dollars to raise this fund. I like to think
of Mrs. Summers in our balmy climate, enjoying this beautiful
home, and not having to move anymore, and I am sure if they
accept her you will be glad to provide the necessary funds. With
our fifteen dollars per month for clothes and incidentals she will
be very comfortable.
I am not including in this report the amounts contributed by the
various Divisions and Chapters where there are no Divisions, as
the Treasurer-General will give this at the close of this report.
If the Amendment raising the *>er capita tax is not passed at this
Convention, I would respectfully ask for a few minutes time for
the Treasurer-General to take pledges for this fund for the coming
year.
I wish to thank the President-General and the Treasurer-General
for their unfailing interest and assistance in this work—also each
of the State Directors, who have done their utmost to make this
year's work a successful one; and I thank you again for the priv-
ilege of serving you in this capacity.
Sincerely yours,
JULIA HARRISON NORRIS,
(Mrs. Amos H.)
Chairman Mrs. Norman V. Randolph
Relief Fund.
Mrs. Kate Hobbs,
President, Board of Management,
Old People's Home,
Tampa, Florida.
My dear Mrs. Hobbs:—
You will recall our conversation of a few days ago in regard
to Mrs. Louise Summers, a charge of the Uniited Daughters of
the Confederacy; and I am writing to you as President of the
Board and requesting that you take up with your Board the


## p. 179 (#183) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 179
granting of a life membership to Mrs. Summers in the Home.
I know it is against the rules of your institution to admit any-
one other than a resident of Hillsborough County as an inmate
of the Home, but I am in hopes you will make an exception
in this case.
Mrs. Summers is a widow of a Confederate soldier, a Vir-
ginian, who lived for many years before his death and whose
widow still lives in Detroit, Michigan. He left her in very
destitute circumstances. She had one child, a son who is dying
of tuberculosis in a sanitarium there, a public charge. Since
he has been confined there his mother has been dependent on
the Daughters of the Confederacy. We have given her a pen-
sin of $15.00 per month, all that we can possibly pay to her,
and the Richmond Chapter of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy gives her $5.00 a month, making a total income of
$20.00 per month. She has helped out this meager fund by
making bungalow aprons for the Woman's Exchange, but for
the last year work has been scarce and a woman of seventy-
one years old is not capable of earning a great deal anyway.
In a recent letter from her she gave a new address and she
stated "I have moved again—the fifth time in a year, because
rents are constantly going up and I can not get a room for less
than $25.00 per month ($5.00 more than she is receiving per
month). Why don't the Daughters of the Confederacy put me
in a home somewhere. Oh! how I long for a home. I am
getting so tired of moving."
We have no National Home. The State Home for Confederate
Veterans near Jacksonville does not admit women, and I am
wondering if you will not set aside your rules and let us raise
the money to pay for a life membership for this old lady, which
we can easily do by subscriptions at our coming General Con-
vention held in Hot Springs, Arkansas, beginning Wednesday,
November 17th. If you can see fit to grant her this membership
I will wire the information to the Convention and head the
subscriptions myself. She is not at all helpless and could be
quite useful with sewing in the Home.
Believing you appreciate the work of the Daughters of the
Confederacy and will help us if you can, and with sincere
good wishes for your work in the future, I am,
Sincerely yours,
JULIA HARRISON NORRIS,
(Mrs. Amos H.)
Chairman of the Confederate Women's
Relief Fund,
United Daughters of the Confederacy.
The President-General resumed the Chair.
Miss Susan R. Davis, of New York, asked that the ques-
tion of endorsement of her book be given a hearing that
a motion Mrs. Lanier had tried to offer during the morn-
ing session be now read.


## p. 180 (#184) ############################################

180 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The Corresponding Secretary-General, Mrs. Chesley,
moved that Mrs. Lanier be allowed to present her motion.
Carried.
Mrs. Lanier, of Connecticut, stated:
"Because a book endorsed by the Chairman of Southern Litera-
ture and Endorsement of Books was approved by the United
Daughters of the Confederacy at the Convention held in Savannah,
was removed from the shelves of the Southern Exposition held in
New York, last May, I move that the Convention assembled express
endorsement of the action taken at Savannah and approve the
placing of the book entitled 'Authentic History of the Ku Klux
Klan 1865-77' among other books of Southern authors at any time
or in any place where books are sold."
Seconded by Mrs. Parker.
Mrs. Merchant, of Virginia, moved that this motion be
referred to the Committee on Endorsement of Books.
Carried.
The Chair announced consideration of amendments to
By-Laws in order.
The proposed amendment to Article VII, Section 2, was
then read.
Amendment proposed by Mrs. W. J. WoodlifF, Registrar-General:
Amend Section 2, Article VII, of the General by-laws, by striking
out the word "twenty" in the third line of said section, and in
lieu thereof insert word "thirty-five." After the word "roll" in
the fourth line of said section, add the words, "fifteen cents of
said sum to be set aside and used for the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph
Relief Fund for Needy Confederate Women."
The section will then read as follows:
Section 2. Each Chapter shall, on or before the first day of
March, pay into the General Treasury, through the Division Treas-
urer, the annual per capita fee of thirty-five cents for every mem-
ber who shall at that time be in good standing on the Chapter
Roll, fifteen cents of said sum to be set aside and used for the Mrs.
Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund for Needy Confederate Women.
Any Chapter in arrears of dues shall stand suspended until de-
linquent dues are paid.
Mrs. Woodbury, of Kentucky, spoke against the pro-
posed amendment, quoting Chief Justice Marshall—"The
power to tax is the power to destroy." Mrs. Long of

she was opposed to a special tax and that her state pre-
ferred to bring its contribution to the relief fund each
year as usual.
The Treasurer-General spoke in favor of the amend-
ment, relating past experiences of unfulfilled promises
and the need of definite funds for this work. Miss Pop-
penheim stated that if an increase in tax were agreed to,
appropriations from the general fund sufficient to cover
this great work could be made in annual convention.
Mrs. Schuyler moved to amend by striking out the
words "fifteen cents of said sum to be set aside and used
for the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund for Needy
Confederate Women."
After some discussion as, to using for this specific pur-
pose the surplus moneys in the general fund, Mrs. Higgins
moved to amend the amendment by substituting "thirty"
for "thirty-five."
Seconded by Miss Poppenheim.
Mrs. Clay, Mrs. Wells, Mrs. Tompkins and Mrs. Holt
spoke against any increase in taxes and urged contin-
uance of voluntary contributions.
Mrs. Rolling, of Virginia, spoke in favor of the pro-
posed amendment, stating the first work should be re-
lief for these needy women; that the Daughters every
year make large appropriations to scholarships and to
Monticello, etc., and annual appropriations would elimi-
nate the perennial begging for this great work.
Mrs. Henderson, of Mississippi, read the paragraph of
the Ry-Laws entitled "Objects" and stated that the
United Daughters of the Confederacy were committed
to this work.
After some further discussion the amendment as
amended was carried.

182 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, spoke in favor of the pro-
posed amendment, stating that so great an organization

plea for the rural districts where many could not now
pay dues; Mrs. Bradley, of Tennessee, spoke for the

## p. 188 (#192) ############################################

188 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The Chairman, Mrs. John L. Woodbury, read the re-
port of the Special Committee, Jefferson Davis Highway,
which upon motion was accepted:
REPORT OF THE JEFFERSON DAVIS HIGHWAY COMMITTEE
Madam President and members of the 32nd General Convention
United Daughters of the Confederacy:
The Jefferson Davis Highway Committee, along with other lines
of human endeavor, has a varied report. Hard work has been done
all along the line, and while all our projects have not gone as we
wished, yet we report progress. Early in the year glorious news
came from Virginia. Mrs. B. A. Blenner, Division Director, wrote
in February: "Under an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia, -
1924, a commission appointed by the Governor was authorized to
spend a certain sum of money, appropriated by the State for mark-
ing historic spots on the roads. This commission met a few days
ago, and decided to place the first marker at Arlington, the home
of General Robert E. Lee, in April, with appropriate ceremonies.
The other historic spots on the Jefferson Davis Highway will then
be marked, it being the purpose to finish marking historic spots
on one highway before work on any other highway is begun."
When trees have been planted this will complete this section of
the highway, and to guard it will be the sacred duty of the Virginia
Division. To keep the name of Jefferson Davis and the work of
the highway before the public it is suggested that State associa-
tions be formed called Jefferson Davis Highway associations, of-
ficers to be those of Confederate descent, both men and women,
details to be worked out by the States as such associations are
formed.
Passing on into North Carolina, this State was able to report
last year that not only temporary but permanent markers, these
last every ten miles, had been placed throughout the State. The
Division Director, Mrs. Mendenhall, writes that the Division
will plant the crepe myrtle red and white, along the route. At
the next meeting the North Carolina General Assembly, the Daugh-
ters will ask the Legislature to pass a bill designating the width
of the highway, and giving permission to plant the trees. Mrs.
Mendenhall has also done good press work, which is vittal to us.
South Carolina has all the temporary marking done, in Feb-
ruary the Edward Croft Chapter of Aiken, unveiled a huge granite
boulder as a permanent marker. It is marked Jefferson Davis
Highway, stands at York and Richland Avenues, and commem-
orates the successful resistance by General Wheeler's forces and
the Home Guards of Aiken, offered to the Northern General Kirk-
patrick.
Georgia has submitted no report, so we infer the designation
through Atlanta has not been secured. We know the historic
route southward through the State, the scenes of the retreat of
Mr. Davis, is already marked by the association headed by Mr.
Isadore Gelders of Fitzgerald, Ga., which became affiliated with us
last year.


## p. 189 (#193) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 189
Alabama's director having secured the designation of route by
name, just as we were ready for the Savannah Convention, was
compelled to give up the work, much to our regret. Active work
has not been' done, but Governor W. C. Brandon at the good roads
meeting in Houston, in a public address, commended the work of
the United Daughters of the Confederacy and expressed his per-
sonal interest and willingness to help.
Mrs. M. H. Houston, director for Mississippi, sent the following
press notice: "There is only one more bridge to be completed and
'that awful road through Tate County' will be a thing of the past,
and in its stead one of the finest roads in the country will come
South from Memphis, winding its way to New Orleans. The old
Hernando road, the oldest road from Mississippi into Memphis,
will pass into history, and its new name will be the Jefferson
Davis National Highway. This road was an old stage road, built
in 1832, was the first stage coach line to run into Memphis. Many
old Southern homes are to be seen from this road, and over it
General Forrest rode into Memphis. The old Wallace home at
Senatobia, his headquarters, is one of the historic spots which
should be marked. Not much marking has been done in this State,
but the present Highway Department is willing to assist the
Daughters in the work. This refers to the North "and South route
through Mississippi, the work is well in hand in Tennessee and in
Kentucky. In the latter the United Daughters of the Confederacy
have had to wait on the road work, but we are assured by the
State Highway Commission that our highway will be a hard sur-
faced road by July 1926, when our attention will be given to per-
manent markers and tree planting. It would not be wise to place
these until road construction is complete.
. Up to this point all has been well, and those of you who have
been giving close attention have no doubt said to yourselves: "This
is almost too good to be true." When the road starts into Mis-
sissippi from the Alabama line, there trouble begins. The Old
Spanish Trails Association wishes to take our route through
Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, and have done considerable
marking. They have a highly paid office force, and get out ex-
pensive literature, but the fact remains that the association was
not started until 1915, the Jefferson Davis Highway being two
years earlier. Another fact also stares us in the face and that is
that in some places our members have not used their opportunities.
Just as a muscle or a faculty unused loses its power, so our high-
way neglected by the Daughters has been appropriated by others.
This is a grave matter, and one on which your committee is hard
at .work.
In Texas a strange thing happened. The present Highway Com-
mission when it went into office named many of the State roads.
In this work took the name Jefferson Davis from the road running
east and west, replaced it with Stephen F. Austin, placing the
name Jefferson Davis on a splendid State road running north and
south. Your Chairman and Honorary Chairman went to Austin,
interview the governor, Mrs. Miriam Ferguson, and had a hearing
before the Highway Commission. We showed them the action of
the Texas Legislature in 1920. a copy of which is attached to this
report, and explained to them with the map, that the Jefferson
Davis Highway was a transcontinental route, and that the strip
north and south broke into our project. They agreed to put the

190 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
name back. The Texas director wrote that they would soon begin
marking, but eternal vigilance is the price of safety for highways
as well as nations.
Mrs. T. E. Mears of Portales, New Mexico, has been successful
in having the highway designated by name in that State. In the
seventh Legislature of New Mexico, Senate Joint Resolution No. 5,
introduced by R. G. Bryant, is as follows: "Be it resolved by the
Legislature of the State of New? Mexico that the Jefferson Davis
National Highway, proposed by the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy and Sons of Confederate Veterans and advocated by the
National Highway Association, be routed through New Mexico as
follows: Commencing at a point on the concrete highway be-
tween El Paso and Las Cruces at the State line between New
Mexico and Texas, thence north to Las Cruces, thence west over
the 7% system of New Mexico, through Cambray, Deming, Gage,
Separ, Lordsburg, Steins and Rodeo to the Arizona line, all being
improved roads except the road from Las Cruces to the county
line between Dona Ana and Luna Counties." The resolution fur-
ther provides for sending copies to the organizations interested
and to Mrs. Mears.
When Mrs. W. T. Crawford of Arizona came to this committee
she found that the road first asked for by the United Daughters
of the Confederacy had been secured by the Bankhead highway.
Nothing daunted, she had a bill prepared designating a more
northern route but capable of being joined to the original route
at the State lines. This bill was presented by Mr. Orme. On
May 2, 1925, a letter from the State Engineer, W. C. LeFebre,
was received by our director. "In conformity with House con-
current resolution No. 3 of the House of Representatives, seventh
Legislature, State of Arizona, you are hereby authorized to place
the necessary signs on the right of way of the State highways
to be covered by the route of the Jefferson Davis National High-
way, which is set forth in said resolution and being more par-
ticularly described as follows:
Commencing at the eastern border of the State, near Franklin
and Duncan, thence to Solomonville and Safford, thence to San
Carlos and Rice, to Globe and via Roosevelt Dam to Mesa, thence
to Tempe and Phoenix, from Phoenix to Buckeye via the Gillespie
Dam, following the State highway to Yuma, being the westerly
termination of said highway. In addition to this routing you are
further authorized to place signs on the alternate route from Globe
through Superior to Apache Junction the junction of the Apache
trail with the Mesa-Superior highway. These signs are to be
placed in conformity with our conservation of yesterday. Thus
armed, Mrs. Crawford accompanied the truck which carried labor-
ers and supplies and personally superintended the marking of 440
miles of road throughout the State of Arizona. This cost $420.00,
of which the United Daughters of the Confederacy paid $400.00,
Mrs. Crawford donating $20.00 in addition to her priceless labor.
On June 18, she wrote: "At last Arizona has the Jefferson Davis
Highway marked through the State and we are feeling very proud
to have helped honor our hero in this manner. The task was long
and hot, the thermometer stood at 114 in the shade (and there
was no shade) the last four days we were out. The telephone
company refused to allow the marking on their poles, but the
automobile club was more generous and their iron posts all over
"\

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 191
the State were used. In addition, Mrs. Crawford had some poles
set, used some cliff sides and built a few rough stone monuments.
This has been described in detail as it is the banner accomplish-
ment of the year. Verily, many Daughters have done worthily,
but thou excellest them all.
Our California director, Mrs. Montgomery, has been quite ill,
and unable to get at this work. Last year the Highway Commission
stated that their State does not name any memorial roads, but has
no objection to organizations such as our own, putting up mark-
ers, provided they are asked for on printed forms from the depart-
ment. These will be sent to us when we wish to begin work. As
the next good roads meeting is in California, it is hoped interest
will be aroused so as to get this done before their meeting be-
gins.
This concludes the States on the route, from other States have
come messages of interest and encouragement such that I wish it
were possible for us to quote each one. Mrs. McKinnon. the
Florida Director, holds first place for money contribution, $176.00,
while Mrs. Lincoln, Director from Massachusetts, along with fi-
nancial report, sends a sonnet, by a Massachusetts Confederate,
which is as real a contribution as a material one. A copy is with
this report.
All financial contributions are in the report of our Treasurer-
General, so it is not necessary to report them here.
Ms. A. B. Davis, President Stonewall Jackson Chapter of Cin-
cinnati, duplicated the Highway dinner given at Savannah when
her Chapter entertained the Ohio Division Covention, October, 1925.
Early in the summer press notices began to appear in regard to
a conference in Washington, August 3rd, to designate Federal aid
highways, accordingly the following telegram was sent August 2nd.:
Thos. H. McDonald, Chief of Bureau of Public Roads,
Washington, D. C.
The United Daughters of the Confederacy, in accord with
resolution adopted at thirty-first annual convention, November
1924, Savannah, Ga., respectfully ask that your Board of Fed-
eral and State officials consider the Jefferson Davis Highway,
Washington to San Francisco as one of the roads to be in-
cluded in the plans of your conference August 3rd. This road
is number 19 on large map of National Highway Association.
Mrs. John L. Woodbury,
Chairman Jefferson Davis Highway.
Senators, Representatives, road men, and others whom we
thought might be of assistance were written and telegraphed to,
our former Chairman, Miss West, doing much of this work. It
finally developed that the object of this conference was to select
and number routes which follow the prevailing flow of traffic.
A letter from E. W. James of the Bureau of Public roads, concludes
a letter with this: "It appears that among the numbered routes
selected by the Joint Board a very substantial part of the route


## p. 192 (#196) ############################################

192 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
so called (that is Jefferson Davis) has been included." Date of
August 10, 1925. After all our worry we have concluded that this
is advertising as our maps have been filed with several boards
and persons, where our work was unknown before. The press
of Nov. 8, 1925, carried illustrations of the signs proposed with
this explanation: "After several years of study and research, a
uniform code of highway markers has been devised, and they are
to be installed on all Federal roads which were recently designated
through the country. * * * Installation of these markers will start
early next spring."
These are mostly safety signals and will not interfere with nam-
ing and marking memorial highways. One of the officials wrote
me that the Government would consider efficiency—shortest route
between points—rather than sentiment. Since ours is an organiza-
tion in which sentiment properly plays a large part, we will con-
tinue our work as first planned.
Your Chairman represented you at the Good Roads Convention
in April, held in Houston, Texas, speaking on the program on
"Woman's Part in the Good Roads Movement." Much good was
accomplished especially in securing the promise of help from the
Governors of Mississippi and Alabama, and the California delegate.
It is important to have our work presented to all such bodies, and
when a comparison of accomplishment is made it will gratify you
to know that our work is progressing about as well as any of
these memorial highways. When a comparison is made of salaries
paid and money spent for advertising, then this organization stands
without a peer—for the amount of work done on a small basis.
Up to the present year with the exception of our map, the only
advertising matter we have had is a leaflet compiled by the Chair-
man this past summer. This has been mailed to every Chapter in
the organization, designed as a help on the Jefferson Davis High-
way program which we recommended last year. The response
has been countrywide. Many Chapters report program meetings,
many asked for programs to follow, which has been sent them,
many promised to hold such meeting. It was evident in some in-
stances that it was the first definite information some of the Chap-
ters had ever received. We cannot be interested, to the point of
supporting, that of which we know nothing. The response to
this little folder indicates a deep and abiding interest in Jefferson
Davis the man, as well as the memorial highway. In September
at the request of the Mary Frances Hughes Chapter of Nashville,
folders and maps were sent for use at the United Daughters of
the Confederacy's Welcome and Rest Booth, at the Tennessee State
Fair. Through the courtesy of Mrs. J. P. Higgins, the name of
your Chairman has been enrolled as a member of the 49th State
Tour Club—this is a project of the St. Louis Globe Democrat, and
a good piece of advertising.
Since the designation by name is complete with the exception
of California, though of course east to west in Mississippi and
across Louisiana is still claimed by the Old Spanish Trails as well
as our organization it seems advisable to print a new map. From
the Map Shop of the National Highways Association, Washington,
D. C., of which Mr. John C. Mulford is chief cartographer, we
have received an estimate for printing our highway on a large
map, in colors, showing other roads, but with our road featured
by being printed in an especially broad line in some striking color.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 193
The cost of this would be $170.00 for the first thousand, and
$110.00 for every additional thousand, plus shipping charges.
The Committee recommends that 3,000 be printed.
The Committee recommends also that each Chapter have one
program on the Jefferson Davis Highway each year.
The Committee recommends further that a Jefferson Davis High-
way book be printed. A page to be given to each State on the
route, with mileage and descriptive matter. Illustrations where
possible. This book could be sold for a small sum and would
probably pay for itself in time.
I cannot close this report without some acknowledgment of my
appreciation of the loyal support of the State Directors, and also
of the unfailing interest of two of our general officers, Mrs. Frank
Harrold and Mrs. J. P. Higgins, they being the two with whom the
work brought the Chairman in contact.
When one looks on a lovely landscape and sees a road, the heart
beats a little faster, because we recognize the human touch—others
like ourselves with hopes and fears, have passed that way. When
our Jefferson Davis Highway shall stretch like a silver ribbon
across our land from sea to shining sea, with an auxiliary ribbon
tying together the birthplaces of our hero with the city in which
he died, then that ribbon will help to mark the place in American
history of our leader—statesman, soldier, patriot and Christian-
Jefferson Davis.

From the report of Miss Decca Lamar West—
Pages 108-109. ,
"In Texas the greatest results were achieved, as we succeeded
in having a number of state highways designated, "The Texas
Division of the Jefferson Davis National Highway." This was
accomplished by an appeal to the state highway commission to
recommended that this be done. In that recommendation a concur-
rent resolution was introduced by Hon. J. W. Stevens, representa-
tive, of Victoria, in the House; and Hon. Chas. H. Murphy, of
Houston, in the Senate. The extract from the House Journal of
the 37th legislature of Texas follows:—

194 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
"Relating to designation of State Highways Mr. Stevens offered
the following resolution:
H. C. R. No. 28, Relating to the Jefferson Davis National High-
way.
Whereas at the suggestion of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy the State Highway Commission, on December 20, 1920,
designated the Texas Division of the Jefferson Davis National
Highway along the following route; beginning at the Louisiana
state line on state highway No. 3, and traveling the same to Orange,
Houston, Fort Bend and St. Barnard, thence over No. 9 to Karnes
City, Floresville and Del Rio, thence over No. 1 to El Paso, from
Beeville to Gregory over No. 9, thence to Brownsville to No. 12.
Whereas to further honor the name of the great statesman and
soldier whose memory is engraved on the hearts of all true sons
of the South, the United Daughters of the Confederacy desires
that the legislature of the state of Texas gives the prestige of its
approval to the designation of a Highway as the Texas division of
the Jefferson Davis National Highway and—
Whereas the promotion of the "all the year open route" will
assist in the development of a large portion of the state, adding
materially to its renown as a winter resort and to homeseekers,
therefore be it resolved:
THAT the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring,
hereby approves the action of the State Highway Commission in
designating the Texas division of the Jefferson Davis National
Highway."
The resolution was read the second time and adopted. A year
later the commission added designation from Austin to Laredo.
A HIGHWAY MEMORIAL
J. H. D.
"The last shall be ifirst."
Across the Sovereign States a Highway long
Doth weave a patriot-path from sea to sea,
That all may hear, with joyous melody,
The message,—that the right o'ercometh wrong,—
Adown the patient years,—the glorious song
The Daughters sing, of gracious Liberty,
Whose sires and dames fain sought their Land to free
Around the Banner of the Chieftain strong!
That Chieftain's way was strewn with rock and thorn;
An outcast, was he, hurled by cruel hate,
From leadership and from his righteous throne!
But, year by year, despite relentless scorn.
The Shaft memorial and the Highway straight
Attest his worth,—he cometh to his own!

Mrs. Woodbury then read ad seriatim the recommenda-
tions contained in her report. The first was adopted as
read; the second was adopted after amendment by in-
serting the word "requests" after the word "committee;"
the third was adopted as read.
The first recommendation was read and adopted.
The Committee recommends that 3,000 be printed.
The second recommendation was then read and adopt-
ed after amendment by inserting the word "requests" af-
ter the word "committee."
The Committee recommends also that each Chapter have one
program on the Jefferson Davis Highway each year.
The third recommendation was then read and adopted.
The Committee recommends further that a Jefferson Davis
Highway book be printed. A page to be given to each State on
the route, with mileage and descriptive matter. Illustrations
where possible. This book could be sold for a small sum and
wouldl probably pay for itself in time.
Miss Decca Lamar West, Chairman Special Committee,
Boulder to Jefferson Davis at Point Isabel, Texas, read
the following report, which was accepted.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE FOR JEFERSON DAVIS BOULDER TO
COMMEMORATE LANDING OF JEFFERSON DAVIS,
COMMANDING MISSISSIPPI TROOPS, U. S. A.
AT POINT ISABEL IN 1846.
Those of you who follow closely the procedure of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy will recall that the General Chairman
of the Jefferson Davis National Highway Committee, Miss Decca
Lamar West, (1917 1923) in 1921 recommended the placing of a
natural Boulder of Texas grey granite to mark the landing of
Jefferson Davis, (then Colonel of U. S. A.) at Point Isabel, Texas,
in 1846. This memorial had a double purpose; to commemorate

especially the great military service of Jefferson Davis to the
United States, for he is accredited with turning the tide of battle
in saving the troops of Zachary Taylor from annihilation at
Buena Vista and was acclaimed the hero of Buena Vista and
Monterey. For his gallantry and military strategy on these oc-
casions he was offered the rank of Brigadier General of the United
States Army and the chain of mountains extending from New
Mexico down through western Texas were named in his honor,
the Davis Mountains, and a U. S. military frontier post was called
Fort Davis. The other point of consideration in the placing of
this Boulder was that it was to mark the most southern point of
the Jefferson Davis National Highway System. The Committee
first reported on the estimate of Boulder and Tablet which report
was unanimously adopted. The next report recommended that the
Committee be empowered to use its judgment as to the exact
location of the Boulder, as the actual historic spot is on a sandy
peninsula, not always accessible and still in litigation as to owner-
ship. The Committee was therefore empowered to secure a site
at Brownsville, twenty miles inland. This they have been en-
deavoring to do for the past three years. In September, with the
approval of the President-General, your Chairman went in person
to Brownsville, (When I tell you it took her longer to go from her
home in Central Texas to Brownsville and Point Isabel, than it
did to come to Hot Springs and required twice as much for rail-
road fare, (on account of annual rate to Hot Springs) you may
have some idea of the difficulties under which we have worked.)
Whether the proximity of Brownsville to the land of "Manana"
has affected them or they are simply conservative, their procedure
has been slow. The Chairman was treated with most delightful
courtesy and hospitality and all things were promised as to City
Commission action. However, even after a five days' stay, work-
ing up a sentiment for organizing a United Daughters of the Con-
federacy Chapter which could further assist, it is only after nearly
three months and arriving in Hot Springs, that we have received
a telegram from the Mayor and Commission that a site selected
when at Brownsville was officially tendered. It took quite a bit
of correspondence and three telegrams during the past two weeks
to get the final action. Your Chairman took the liberty of stretch-
ing her- conscious to tell the authorities that unless the city took
immediate action, (fell on its knees, so to speak) the United
Daughters of the Confederacy offer would be withdrawn. Of
course, we knew it would not if we were alive and could still
wag our tongue, but she felt the Brownsvillans (not villian) needed
a slight stimulus. The results were satisfactory.
We were disappointed that it was not decided soon enough to
renew correspondence with Mr. Teiche of Llanno, Texas, whose
estimates were approved by committee and convention in 1923.
A wire to Mr. Teiche asking if he can make us a still better offer
has been sent with hope that his reply will come before close of
this convention. In which case we will ask to make a supple-
mentary report. Otherwise we recommend the committee be in-
structed to proceed with the work as heretofore unanimously ap-
proved.
The site for the Boulder, as stated above, marks the most south-
ern point of the Jefferson Davis Highway, being the terminus of

the branch from Beeville (Main East and West line) to Browns-
ville. It will be placed where the Jefferson Davis Highway,
claimed by other routes, a beautiful, hard surfaced road, connects
with a splendid Boulevard about one hundred and fifty feet in
width. In the center of this Boulevard are velvet turfed, cement
curbed spaces twenty-two feet wide by eighty feet long. In the
center of one of these park spaces the large natural boulder of
grey Texas granite will be placed. It is just in front of two
splendid new Senior and Junior High Schools and we may con-
gratulate ourselves that it will stand as an object lesson for the
truth of history to hundreds of children who will see it daily.
Literally thousands of tourists pass the spot each week for re-
member Matamoros is just across the river and the interest in the
scenery in Mexico has increased marvelously since the passage
of the Nineteenth Amendment!
But seriously, and best of all, this spot is a iunction of the
Jefferson Davis National Highway and a magnificent hard sur-
faced road which already goes nearly one hundred miles up thru
the far famed citrus fruit country of the Magic Valley of the Rio
Grande and another proposed coastwise drive from Brownsville
to Galveston that will materialize.
It is within the bounds of possibility that we may some day
extend the Jefferson Davis Highway across the Rio Grande over
the same route traversed by American troops under the command
of General Zachery Taylor and Colonel Jefferson Davis in 1846.
The new Chapter at Brownsville will be known as the Rio
Grande Valley Chapter, drawing its membership from valley towns
extending along a hundred miles west, making a special effort to
preserve Southern traditions and historic spots in the midst of a
largely northern and foreign population.
They will mark the exact spot at Point Isabel where Jefferson
Davis drilled the Taylor troops, so this Boulder, tho but a stone
already has its influence, even as a seed planted in fertile soil.
It will be one more sacred memorial to prove our loyalty; our
demand that all the world shall know the history and honor the
name Jefferson Davis.

ent insignia and moved that she be instructed to obtain
a patent thereon. Carried.
Upon request of Mrs. Woodbury, of Kentucky, Mrs.

to the one authorized.
Mrs. McKinney, of Kentucky, moved that this most im-
portant information brought to the floor by the Washing-
ton representative be referred to the Second Vice-Presi-
dent and that she be instructed to get all the information
and consider it one of her most important duties during
the year to have this matter cleared up. Carried.
The Treasurer-General, Mrs. Higgins, stated that the
pledges to the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund

REPORT OF OFFICIAL STATIONERY COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
Your Chairman of Official Stationery Committee regrets that
she can not be with you in person to present this report.
Many letters have been written to Chapters and individuals an-
swering inquiries about prices and samples of stationery as well
as replying to requests of officers and chairmen for stationery.
The Committee has found the Paducah Printing Company most
courteous in their willingness to aid the Committee at all times,
and their promptness and efficiency have merited our thanks and
commendation.
We would recommend that officers and chairmen use the letter-
heads or post cards of this organization rather than correspondence
cards or note paper as both are expensive. The cost of stationery
for officers and chairmen will be given in the Treasurer-General's
report as all bills are approved by your Chairman, your President-
General and paid by Treasurer-General. The exact amount can
not be given at this time as some stationery was ordered only a
short time ago for which invoice has not been received.
We wish to express our appreciation to Mrs. Frank Harrold,
President-General, for the privilege of having had a part in the
work of this great organization. It has been a pleasure to serve
the Cause we love, and to keep in touch with this splendid body
of patriotic women.

The Chair announced the report of the Committee on
Award of University Prize in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Miss Alice Baxter, Mrs.
Livingston Rowe Schuyler read the report of that com-
mittee, which upon motion was accepted without its
recommendations.
REPORT UNIVERSITY PRIZE ESSAY COMMITTEE
Madam President and Daughters of the Convention:
Your Chairman of University Prize Essay cannot better begin
her report than by giving you a sentence from Dr. Ulrich D.
Phillips, a Georgian and holding the chair of History in the Uni-
versity of Michigan: "I am glad to learn of the fruition of the
project concerning which I have had some correspondence with
Mesdames Schuyler and Jennings." Dr. Phillips for years has been
associated with Mrs. Schuyler and Mrs*. Jennings in their work for
the Prize Essay. As the Daughters of the Confederacy well know
this Prize Essay Contest originated with Mrs. L. R. Schuyler, of
New York, whose first conception was to give a prize on some
subject of Southern History to certain Northern Universities. Out
of this grew the present work which has been wonderfully ad-
vanced now by the gift from Mr. Bernard M. Baruch of $10,000.00
as a Memorial to his mother. The direction which this Memorial
should take was suggested by Mrs. Schuyler, so that to her the
organization owes the privilege it now has of offering a prize on
Southern History which will command the attention of Univer-
sities and College throughout the States.
Neither Mrs. Schuyler, nor Mrs. Jennings, the former Chairman,
found it practicable to undertake the chairmanship of the Prize
Essay Committee when it was offered them by Mrs. Frank Harrold.
It was then offered to your present Chairman. Owing to illness in
her family Mrs. Jennings could not give the desired information
about the contest until the first of September. Since that time
your Chairman co-operating with her committee and receiving
great help from Mrs. Jennings, former chairman has endeavored
to get certain important measures ready for recommendation to
the Convention. Anticipating acceptance of the two measures
which the Committee recommends your Chairman has endeavored
to learn from educators how the prize might be received and also
to obtain from these Historians suggestions as to the conduct of
the work and gives below excerpts from some of these letters:
Dr. John H. Latane, Chair of History, Johns Hopkins University:
"I am much interested in what you have to say of the prize to be
offered bv the Daughters of the Confederacy as the result of Mr.
Baruch's gift. If you will permit I will make a few suggestions.
I think you will get best results by not announcing any particular
subject, but by letting students submit any papers which they may
have prepared on any phase of Southern History."
Dr. Albert Bushncll Hart of Harvard: "Let me express great
pleasure and satisfaction at the offering of a prize which cannot

fail to inspire a type of Historical work which will be very useful
primarily to the South and then to the whole country. The South
is full of interesting topics awaiting adequate treatment and your
society is in position, if it chooses, to foster impartial and searching
history work."
Dr. Wm. E. Dodd, University of Chicago: "The prize as now
established, is just the sort of thing needed these many years and
it puts the Daughters definitely on the map for genuine work. My
judgment is that research should be highly emphasized, also a
number of people whose writings scholars will not agree to read
as judges will enter the competition."
Walter L. Fleming, Dean and Professor of History, Vanderbilt
University: "I am much interested to know of the substantial
prizes which the United Daughters of the Confederacy are now
able to offer in the interest of Southern History. As to. the period
covered, I should say the whole of Southern History should be the
field. Thank you for writing me about this very important aid in
the stimulation of research in Southern History. By all means
require original research or strikingly original interpretation."
Mr. H. W. Chase, President University of North Carolina: "I
am quite sure that a prize such as you mention for essays on
Southern History will be of interest to Professors in Colleges and
Universities throughout the country. It seems to me that it ought
to result in some excellent work and I congratulate you on being
in position to offer such a fine prize."
Your Chairman felt assured of the sympathy that would nat-
urally come from Southern Colleges, so preliminary correspondence
was with Northern Universities and she heard favorably in reply
to every letter, except a University in the far West. You will be
pleased to know that the recommendations as to the general topic
of Southern History and the requirement of original research
was in accord with the idea of both Mrs. Schuyler and Mrs.
Jennings.
Trusting this report will give you some conception of the great
possibilities within the scope of your Prize Essay Contest.

Dear Miss Baxter:
I should not recommend any upper limit to the length of
the essays to be submitted in the U. D. C. competitions. If
they run to the size of substantial books, so much the better.
As to lower limit, ten thousand words would be reasonable,
but in this case (as also in the case of citations and sources)
it would be well to phrase the statement so as to allow the
judges some leeway in regard to exceptionally meritorious

essays, which may not meet all the technical requirements.
For example: "It is expected that essays will not be less than
some ten thousand words in length," or, "Essays should, etc."
I thank you for your kind personal expressions. I expect
to ramble through the South next Spring (in March and later)

Dear Miss Baxter:
I am glad to learn of the fruition of the prospect concerning
which I have had some correspondence with Mesdames Schuy-
ler and Jennings. My advice is:
1. That the pri2e essay be offered biennially, in two sums
of $500.00 each to be paid to the author of the winning essay,
i. e. $500.00 at the time of the award, and $500.00 additional
when the manuscript shall have been printed.
2. The competition to be open to all students, undergraduate
and graduate, in American universities and standard colleges,
and also to alumni of such institutions, of not more than three
years standing since the taking of their degrees. This latter
inclusion might be expected to promote a sustaining of in-
terests, which is an important consideration for your pur-
poses.
3. Essays to be eligible if pertaining wholly or mainly to
any significant theme in the History of the South. The essays
must be in scholarly form and be based, partly at least, upon
the use of source materials. Important statements in them
should be accompanied with citations of the sources from
which they have been drawn.
I shall be glad to be of any further service to the Daughters
of the Confederacy in the premises
You may be interested to know that I am beginning to write
a general history of the South. I take the liberty of enclosing
its tentative table of contents.
Sincerely yours,
ULRICH D. PHILLIPS.

The Chair announced the report of the Committee, Di-
vision Constitution and By-Laws in order.
The Chairman, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, read
the report of the Committee, Division Constitution and
By-Laws, and then ad seriatim the decisions therein,
which upon motion were adopted.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DIVISION CONSTITUTION AND
BY-LAWS
Madam President:
Your Committee has had only two important decisions to make
since the last Convention, and it submits those in this, asking that
the report be disposed of and the decisions be considered when
unfinished business comes up. These decisions are.
1.
The Maryland Division, which tried to get a report on a proposed
revision of its Constitution and By-Laws in 1924 and failed because
not enough time was allowed for all the committee to consider it,
sent in early in the summer a proposed revision and it was ap-
proved with the following exceptions:
Art. IV. Sec. 4, required all officers of its Chapters to reside in
the same counties in which the Chapters are domiciled, while the
general by-laws say distinctly, "the same section," and in the dis-
cussion of this by-law when it was adopted it was brought out
that if "the same county" was used it would work a hardship on
some of the Chapters in the northern cities where it is necessary
to have the members in more than one county, if they are to be
in the United Daughters of the Confederacy at all, and they often
must have some officers for the different counties where the mem-
bers are living; so it is evident that the word "section" does not
mean "county." Therefore, this provision was in conflict with the
general law.
An Art. not numbered, provides that: "There shall be three
directors who are officers of this Division, whose duty shall be"
(duty not given).
The following decision was rendered on this:
Conflicts with general by-laws, which in Art. Ill, Sec. 3, in stat-
ing how a division shall be organized says "and the election of a
president and other officers." As you copy did not give the duties
of the "Directors" the committee had to go to the dictionary for
the meaning of the word, and finds "One who, or that which di-
rects, regulates," etc.
Now the whole tenor of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
law shows that the president is meant to be the head of the Di-
vision; as it is the president's business to sign all applications for
charter, and all certificates of membership in the United Daughters
of the Confederacy. It is the president who reports on the work
of her Division in the United Daughters of the Confederacy Con-

vention and it is she who must notify the general association
through its officers of the withdrawal or extinction of any Chapter
in her Division; and in differences between "individual members
and Chapter or Division officers, which cannot be adjusted, first
by an appeal to the Division President," thus recognizing that
officer's priority of supervision in her Division. And in every
other way possible the president being the head of her Division
is recognized by the general by-laws. And as the directors would
evidently supercede the Division President in your Division, if
this passed it would be in conflict with the general by-laws."
The first week of October the following question was asked of
the Committee Chairman by the Maryland Division:
"Why was the Maryland Division permitted to adopt 'Paul's
Rules of Order' in the amendments submitted to you last year,
when that is in direct conflict to the general organization, which
states that Mrs. Fox shall be the authority?" After citing her to
the page in the Savannah Minutes containing the report for 1924
of the Committee, and quoting that part which showed that the
proposed amendments to the Constitution and By-laws of the
Maryland Division were never submitted to the Committee as it
came, in too late, to be returned in time for the Convention of that
Division. The following decision was forwarded to the Committee
members and unanimously approved by them. And was then sent
to the President of the Maryland Division:
"'Parliamentary Law is the rule of action for the conduct of
business of a deliberative body.' These 'Deliberative bodies' are
of two kinds; Occasional and Permanent; the United Daughters
of the Confederacy and its Divisions being of the latter class, since
they are required by their Constitution to meet at certain fixed
times."
"Every separate 'deliberative body' must be allowed to make its
own rules to conduct its own business by. For no other body
would know enough of its conditions and its business to make
those rules for it. This is just common justice and sense. And
nowhere in the by-laws of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
does that association attempt to dictate to the Divisions as to the
way in which they must conduct their own business. Now the
expression 'this organization' in Art. XII. of the General By-Laws,
evidently means the general Convention, as that is its 'deliberative
body' and moreover, in speaking of the Convention in another
place, (Art. IV. Sec. 5) we find the same expression referring to
the general organization only.
"Therefore, the Committee holds that Art. XII. refers to the
general organization only, and that each Division has the right to
select its own authority on parliamentary law. Hence, the Mary-
land Division in selecting 'Paul's Rules of Order' has not come in
conflict with the General By-Laws.
"The United Daughters of the Confederacy has always made an
effort not to infringe on the right of every Division to conduct its
affairs which are not connected with any other Division or with
the general organization, in its own way; thus being careful to
uphold the principles of State's Rights."
\


## p. 205 (#209) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 205
This advice was also given, and is repeated here as it may be of
benefit to others:
The Committee thinks it an expedient and wise thing for the
Chapters and Divisions to adopt as nearly as they can the rules
and laws which govern the general organization, since they would
then become more familiar with those rules and laws. But each
must judge for itself what it needs for its own business.
The Chairman received two or three requests for copies of the
Uniform Constitution and By-Laws for Divisions as proposed at
the Washington Convention, and could not furnish them, since the
report of the Committee on Revision submitted at that Conven-
tion was not even printed in the minutes. It is told here to show
how unwise it is for those who edit the minutes to leave out any
of the reports without instructions from the body itself.
LIZZIE GEORGE HENDERSON, Chairman.
The Chair announced the report of the Special Com-
mittee, American Legion History, Yale University Press,

Dr. Matthew Page Andrews reported on the work of
securing data for the American Legion History and on
producing historial motion pictures, and the results so far

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1925
Afternoon Meeting
The afternoon meeting was called to order at 2:30, by
the President-General, Mrs. Harrold.
The Chair announced the report of the Committee
"Women of the South in War Times," in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Mrs. Edwin Robinson,
Mrs. W. H. Thomas read the report of that committee,
which upon motion was accepted.
REPORT OF "WOMEN OF THE SOUTH IN WAR TIMES"
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
Another year has passed and I beg to submit the following re-
port:
In the face of numerous adverse conditions the work of our
book, "Women of the South in War Times," has accomplished
some things. While our mail returns have not been flooded with
enthusiastic letters, from the Division Presidents and the Direc-
tors, and orders have not poured in with the satisfying speed and
volume that we have desired, notwithstanding, we are gratified at
two leading features:
First. The zeal and determination of a number of the Direc-
tors and the Divisions, to finish their quotas.
Second. The co-operative spirit and the realization of the
fact that this obligation is a debt and must be paid.
Before going into details of the report, I wish to express my
appreciation to the following Directors who have sent reports:
Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Lou-
isiana, Mississippi, Maryland, Missouri, Massachusetts, North Car-
olina, North Dakota, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Ohio,
Philadelphia Chapter, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia.
There have been many encouraging features connected with this
work, and we trust the near future holds—for the payment of this
debt—final success.
I have written 233 personal letters and issued 83 circular letters.
After the beginning of the official year, as soon as possible cir-
cular letters suggesting a few new recommendations were sent to


## p. 207 (#211) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 207
all Division Directors, including the Paris and Porto Rico Chap-
ters.
The Division Presidents received their share of these letters.
The Division Presidents can be of wonderful assistance by keep-
ing in touch and co-operating with their Directors.
In September, another circular letter was mailed to the Directors
reminding them of "the fleeting moments, etc."
In the classification of this work there seems to be a significant
group of "Over The Top Divisions," namely, Massachusetts, Mary-
land, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia, who are careful that the
distribution does not stagnate in their Divisions, not in the matter
of urge, but complimentary, all of which goes toward reducing the
publication debt.
In connection with this group it is a noteworthy fact that West
Virginia, Massachusetts and Ohio have again distributed one-half
of their original quotas, and Maryland not far behind. Report as
follows:
West Virginia, Mrs. W. A. Pankey, Quota 200—over 124 (the year
of quota completion.) 100 extra copies. Total 424 copies since
1922-1923.
Massachusetts, Miss Emmeline Ruggles, Quota 10—over 43 copies.
Maryland, Mrs. Clayton Hoyle, Quota 75—over 34 copies.
Ohio, Mrs. Henry V. Shoe, Quota 50—over 27 copies.

United Daughters of the Confederacy's obligation to "Women of
the South in War Times."
North Dakota is the only new State added this year and she
cheerfully responded and put herself on the map, Miss Maude
Hayes, Director.
Mr. Norman's co-operation has been wonderful and helpful be-
yond expression, in supplying literature, multigraphing letters and
always ready "to strengthen the weak and lend a prop to the
needy."
It is of interest to know that "Our Book" has been dramatized
and the pageant that was so successfully produced in Frankfort,
Kentucky, by the children of that place, has been printed in a
booklet. The author of the pageant is Mrs. W. T. Fowler, Frank-
fort, Kentucky.
The distribution of our pledge of 10,000 copies voted at the St.
Louis Convention is as follows:
10,000

South Carolina was the first Division to complete her quota.
THE FACT THAT MISS MARION SALLEY HAD SUCH A SHORT
DISTANCE TO GO, A SECOND PRIZE WAS OFFERED TO THE
NEXT DIVISION TO "GO OVER THE TOP," WITH AN ORIGINAL
QUOTA OF 200 OR MORE. ARKANSAS IS THE WINNER.
For greatest Chapter distribution: "Bethel Heroes Chapter, Rocky
Mount, North Carolina.
A grand total of seven Divisions have fulfilled their pledges, an

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 213
REPORT OF INSIGNIA COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
No work of the Daughters of the Confederacy has brought into
closer touch the generations of the past and present, and linked
together the heroic deeds of son, father, and grandfather, in such
close relationship as the bestowal of the Cross of Service upon
those men of lineal Confederate descent who served in the World
War. It is a work that is compiling for us history of untold value
and is preserving for future generations records that will increase
in value as the years go by. That it is a slow work in its accom-
plishments, so far as great numbers are concerned we fully realize,
but we also realize that each year is emphasizing its importance
and creating by its own strength additional interest and deter-
mination to success. Many suggestions have come to us of changes
that might be made, and may be necessary, but for the present this
Committee realizes most fully the need of adhering to the present
rules in order to avoid confusion at this time. The fact that the
World War Records Committee has asked that the details of be-
stowal be now handled by the Custodian and Recorders of Crosses
as originally intended, make it doubly necessary that no other
change be made at this time. It has been difficult to bring the
Divisions and Chapters to a correct understanding of the rules and
requirements and any additional change would work hardships that
would doubtless delay bestowals, and bring many disappointments
in the bestowal erf the Cross of Service. As originally planned it
has been the aim and desire of our organization to secure from
Congress the necessary permission for the wearing of this Insignia
by its recipients when in regulation uniform. We feel that some
step should be taken in this direction. One of the new United
Slates Senators has received this medal, and doubtless will be will-
ing to assist us with advice and suggestions.
We therefore, recommend that this committee be authorized to
look into the matter and take what steps seem necessary and ad-
visable at this time along this line.
It was the pleasure of this Committee last year to recommend
to the Executive Board the selection of General Harris and General
Parker for decoration by the 1924 Convention, and this year to
recommend the selection of an Arkansas hero as a compliment to
the State in which we are now meeting, and to our First Vice-
President-General, Mrs. J. T. Beal, who since the time of its crea-
tion has been a loyal, faithful member of the World War Records
Committee, and that the other bestowal be to General Mason M.
Patrick, Chief of the United States Air Service. These recommen-
dations were approved by the Executive Board, but owing to the
fact that General Patrick could not be present to receive the medal
the honor has been reserved for him, and Colonel Jefferson Davis
was selected in his stead. We would call to your attention the
fact that General Chas. Summerill, a native of Florida, now the
highest ranking officer in the United States Army, wears the Cross
of Service, that the Cross of Service has been received by General
Lejune, ranking officer of the Marines and many other Generals of
the World War have been similarly honored. Our records are
rapidly establishing the fact that many of the leaders and great
heroes of that war are lineal descendants of Confederate soldiers,


## p. 214 (#218) ############################################

214 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
a fact greatly questioned by some leading newspapers during a
period of the World War.
When we receive just recognition from Congress for the Cross
of Service, we will have established a permanent means of com-
piling great Confederate history insofar as it concerns the present
day.
This Committee also recommends that any change of rules or
manner of bestowal desired should be submitted in writing to the
Committee for consideration before it is presented to the Conven-
tion for action.
No step is taken by this Committee and no recommendation made
without very careful thought and consideration and consultation
with high military officials. It is a matter of such great importance
that we cannot afford to act hastily in any matter concerning its
award. The rules that govern it should never be founded upon
personal or family desires. We must keep in mind always that the
real reason for its existence is the compiling of valuable history.
Our records must be kept so accurately and so clearly and with
such indisputable proof that the Government will recognize them
as authority.
It is with great regret that your Chairman is detained at home
by illness of a serious nature, but her recent progress has been so
encouraging that she now hopes for a very early recovery, and
stands ready to do the work that you may see fit to entrust to her
care.
Faithfully yours,
MRS. J. A. ROUNTREE, Chairman.
Mrs. Frank Harrold,
Miss Mary B. Poppenheim,
Mrs. L. R. Reeves,
Mrs. W. H. Thomas,
Mrs. C. C. Clay.
The first recommendation was read.
We therefore, recommend that this committee be authorized to
look into the matter and take what steps seem necessary and ad-
visable at this time along this line.
Mrs. Lamar, of Georgia, asked that she be permitted
to put a motion to go before the committee so they
might pass upon the feasibility of her plan. Miss Pop-
penheim stated that the recommendation had been ap-
proved unanimously by the committees. Upon motion
the recommendation was adopted.
The second recommendation was then read.
This Committee also recommends that any change of rules or
manner of bestowal desired should be submitted in writing to the


## p. 215 (#219) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 215
Committee for consideration before it is presented to the Conven-
tion for action.
Mrs. Lamar, of Georgia, spoke against the recommen-
dation, protesting against the exclusion of commissioned
women who had served with the Medical Corps of the
Army at the front as she considered them equally en-
titled to the Cross of Service; stating that time is passing
and she was opposed to having this matter go over to
another Convention and then be thrown out on a tech-
nicality; that an American woman who had gone over
when America was too proud to fight had received the
British distinguished service cross in recognition of her
service.
Mrs. Woodbury, of Kentucky, spoke for the recommen-
dation, stating the question had been well considered by
the committee before bringing it to the Convention.
After some further discussion as to whether any change
in wording, or of rules, should be submitted to the com-
mittee, and afterward brought to the Convention, upon
motion the recommendation was adopted.
The Chair announced the report of the World War
Records Committee in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Mrs. J. A. Rountree,
Mrs. W. S. Coleman read the following report, which up-
on motion was accepted.
REPORT OF WORLD WAR RECORD COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
The work of the bestowal of the Cross of Service has gone stead-
ily forward. It has increased in interest and the Divisions have
reached a better understanding. The total of 1924 Crosses of Serv-
ice as reported by the Custodian is not as large a number as we
would like to have given, but we realize that every big undertak-
ing is slow in the beginning. The World War Record Committee
has endeavored in every way to arouse interest in the bestowal,
and we feel that a great work is being accomplished for we are
compiling history, of inestimable value. Even the Daughters of the
Confederacy themselves have scarcely begun to realize the full
historic value of this branch of our work. When we recall how
many years it has taken to bestow Crosses of Honor upon the


## p. 216 (#220) ############################################

216 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Confederate Veterans, we should not become discouraged in our
work of recognizing the military value of their descendants.
Twenty-one States are already carrying on the work, and we
hope that the others will soon follow in line. For the past two
years the World War Record Committee and the Division Directors
serving under them have served in a way as volunteers because
it was originally planned by the Insignia Committee that the be-
stowal should be conducted through the Division and Chapter Re-
corders of the Cross of Honor.
While the work was new we found that it was too great an
undertaking for one officer to serve in such dual capacity and
we therefore, asked to be continued until such time as the States
became familiar with the requirements of the work. We now feel
that we have reached that point in service, and /we ask that the
work be turned over to the Custodian and the Division and Chap-
ter Recorders as originally intended, and that our Directors be re-
lieved from duty.
Owing to the serious illness of our Chairman for the past several
months, we ask that our Central Committee be continued so that
a full and complete report covering all details of our work may
be rendered at the 1926 Convention. This illness coming as it did
in the summer did not hinder the work as it would have done dur-
ing the season when all Chapters are active. Some delays oc-
curred, for which the Chairman expresses great regret, but the
members of her family endeavored to answer all correspondence
as prompt as could be done under the circumstances, the only real
delay occurring between June 15 and August 15, the time when
she was most seriously ill, this being a time when no bestowals
were being made.
The work this year shows, as reported on Historical Evening,
that South Carolina bestowed the greatest number of medals, 402
and, therefore, Mrs. E. J. Burch, Director of South Carolina, won
first Youree prize ($50.00), and that Georgia bestowed 180 medals,
thereby winning second Youree prize ($25.00), and that Philadel-
phia with a membership of 133, bestowed 17 medals, making 13%,
and therefore, Mrs. P. H. Lane, won the Per Capita prize, $25.00.
Our Committee extends congratulations and commendations to
these Directors for the interest they have aroused, and the work
they have accomplished, and desire to especially thank Mrs. Peter
Youree for the inspiration that her confidence and recognition has
given us for so many years. She has been to us a source of power,
and we value the encouragement she has given us during the past
year.
The announcement at Savannah of the Blount Memorial Cup, to
be competed for annually, offered by Mrs. Walter D. Lamar of
Georgia, in memory of her father, Colonel James H. Blount, Floyd
Rifles, 2nd Georgia Battalion, C. S. A., and her brother, Major
James H. Blount, Jr., U. S. A., Cuba, Philippines, World War, has
given additional interest to our work, the cup being offered to the
Division bestowing the greatest number of Crosses of Service dur-
ing the year. The cup this year, as announced Historical Evening,
was won by the South Carolina Division.
Our Committee has suffered great loss in the sorrows that came
to us when Mrs. Jackson Daniel Morrison and Mrs. Cornelia Branch

Stone were taken from us. These two faithful workers, members
of our Committee, from the time of its creation in 1917, (as the
World War Relief Committee), gave to our work the most that
any woman can give, the very best part of themselves, ceaseless
in their efforts, tireless in their endurance, able in their wisdom
and judgment, that helped to guide and direct our efforts toward
the success that has been achieved, no members could have done
more than Ihey, and none could be more greatly missed.
In closing our work and asking that it be turned over to the
Custodian and Recorders of Crosses, we do so with a full realiza-
tion of just what the responsibility means, and we stand ready
as we have always done, to do our full part toward accomplishing
the aim that has been set. We appreciate the confidence that has
been placed in us. We have valued at all times the greatness of
the work, and when our final report is made with summing up of
the whole, we hope that you will feel that we have done our part
in the best way that we knew how.
Faithfully yours,
Mrs. J. A. Rountree, Chairman,
Mrs. W. S. Coleman, Vice-Chairman,
Mrs. Charles R. Hyde,
Mrs. John Woodbury,
Mrs. Philip Holt,
Mrs. J. T. Beal.

REPORT OF THE EDITOR OF THE U. D. C. DEPARTMENT OF
THE CONFEDERATE VETERAN
The issues of the Confederate Veteran since last October com-
prise the real report of the Editor of the U. D. C. Department.
Notes from Divisions and Chapters, with an occasional official re-
quest from an officer or chairman, have appeared in every number
of the Veteran save one, and the space for that month was given
over to a report of the Savannah Convention.


## p. 218 (#222) ############################################

218 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Some of the Publicity Chairmen have been most faithful in send-
ing reports of Division and Chapter activities, being careful, too,
to have them reach me by the first of each month.
The publishing of a magazine every month is far from being a
small task. Even when the notes reach me by the first and arc
mailed to the Veteran on the 4th, they do not appear for six weeks.
Realizing this, you will appreciate the importance of items being
of very recent occurrence. For instance, I have received in August
accounts of Memorial Day exercises held in May. For these to
appear in the September number would be out of the question.
A greater number of communications is omitted for this reason
than for any other.
On behalf of the faithful Publicity Chairmen let me urge each
of you to send to your respective Chairmen anything of outstand-
ing interest in your Chapter, making it concise and to the point.
Unless you do this your Chairman has only the newspapers to
depend upon.
Our space is limited and of necessity details describing decora-
tions, numbers on a program, etc.—points that would suggest them-
selves to any Chapter under similar circumstances—are omitted.
Very often, a particularly clever and original idea is brought out,
and these we are always glad to pass on.
We trust that you have found the accounts of work in other
Divisions interesting, and that helpful suggestions have come to
you thru this department.
In looking over our records we find that two Publicity Chairmen
did not fail during the year in sending a news letter from their
Divisions each month. These were Mrs. Jesse McMahan of Mis-
souri, and Mrs. H. S. Farley of South Carolina. Following close
to these were Mrs. Preston Power of Maryland, Mrs. F. C. Kolman
of Louisiana, and Mrs. William Stillwell of Arkansas.
Let me express to all Publicity Chairmen, and the others who
sent notes of interest, my sincere appreciation for their help in
making it possible for this valuable space to be used in giving pub-
licity to worthwhile activities in their respective Divisions and
Chapters.
Respectfully submitted,
ELOISE WELCH WRIGHT.
(Mrs. R. D.)
The Chairman, Mrs. R. D. Wright, read the report of
the Committee on Subscriptions for the Confederate Vet-
eran, which was accepted without its recommendations.
REPORT OF SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CONFEDERATE VETERAN
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
On page 253 of the Savannah Minutes is found the following
resolution: "That a Committee be appointed, with the Editor of
the U. D. C. Department of the Confederate Veteran as Chairman,


## p. 219 (#223) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 219
with a Director from each Division, to solicit subscriptions to the
Veteran, sending the money thru the Division Treasurer, and the
Treasurer-General."
Upon motion of Mrs. Holt this recommendation was amended
to read that each Chapter Director be instructed to send names
and money to the Division Director, who shall transmit same thru
the Division Treasurer.
My reappointment as Editor of the U. D. C. Department auto-
matically made me Chairman of this body of Directors, and as soon
as possible after the Savannah Convention, work was begun. After
a few weeks it was found that this method of managing the funds
for subscriptions entailed much extra work on the President-
General and on the Treasurer-General. After conferring with Miss
Pope, the Editor of the Veteran, and with your President-General,
Mrs. Harrold, presented the matter to the Executive Committee and
obtained permission that, when a Director preferred, all names of
subscribers and funds for same might be sent direct to the Veteran.
The chief duty of a Division Director in such case was to procure
a Director in every Chapter in her Division, who Would report to
her the names of subscribers, with the amount of money sent to
the Veteran.
A circular letter with these suggestions was sent out early in the
year. On September 1st a personal message was sent to each
Division Director asking for a report of her year's work and for
suggestions as to how we might make our efforts more effective.
Replies came from twelve Division Directors: Alabama, Miss Allie
Garner; California, Mrs. Lucile Pleasants; Georgia, Mrs. R. L. Cater;
Mississippi, Mrs. Carrie Sessums; Missouri, Mrs*. J. T. McMahan;
North Carolina, Mrs. R. P. Holt; Oklahoma, Mrs. C. A. Galbraith;
South Carolina, Mrs. H. S. Farley; Virginia, Mrs. J. B. Stannard;
West Virginia, Mrs. F. J. Manning; Washington, Mrs. Kurt Schluss;
Ohio, Mrs. L. G. Rice. Six Directors of Chapters replied: Oregon,
Mrs. Meador; Fargo, N. D., Mrs. T. H. Hopper; Boston, Mrs. O. F.
Wiley; East Orange, N. J., Mrs. Daniel Graham; Salt Lake City,
Mrs. W. H. Landmesser; Philadelphia, Mrs. Harvey D. Best. Other
Directors sent their reports direct to the Veteran. It was evident
from all the letters received by your Chairman that the writers
are women who have given much thought, effort and time to this
work. Among many fine things reported, we list a few:
In West Virginia, one Chapter has secured fifty-nine subscrip-
tions.
The Fargo, N. D., Chapter has a review of the current Veteran
at each monthly meeting.
The South Carolina Director spoke in the interest of subscrip-
tions at every Division Conference, and wrote 139 letters.
The California Director wrote a letter to every Chapter in the
Spring, and another in September.
The number of subscriptions in the Boston Chapter was doubled
this year.
North Carolina gives $10.00 in gold to the Daughter sending in
the largest number of subscriptions.

After some discussion as to moneys passing through
Division Treasurers and receiving credit therefor, Mrs.
Wright stated she was perfectly willing to accept a
change to effect that object, and the recommendation was
adopted as amended.
The Chair announced the report of the Special Com-
mittee, Lee Memorial Chapel, in order.
The Chairman, Mrs. Roy Weaks McKinney, read the
report on Lee Memorial Chapel, which upon motion was
accepted without its recommendation.
REPORT OF THE LEE MEMORIAL CHAPEL COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and Members of the Convention:
After the close of the last Convention, in accordance with the
recommendation there passed, the Directors of the Divisions that
have contributed to the Lee Memorial Chapel Fund since 1922, were
asked to submit Recommendation Number Two of the Committee's
1924 report to these Divisions in Convention assembled.
This has been done and the Committee again recommends:
That since this money was donated for the Chapel at Washington
and Lee University and since plans for the work have been with-
drawn; since it would be difficult to return the money to the donors
and illegal to divert the fund without the consent of the donors, that
it be converted into a Lee Memorial Trust Fund.
Your Committee has acted upon legal advice in formulating this
recommendation and presents it, for your consideration, in the full
faith that its adoption will protect the best interests of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy.

The recommendation was then read.
That since this money was donated for the Chapel at Washington
and Lee University and since plans for the work have been with-
drawn; since it would be difficult to return the money to the donors
and illegal to divert the fund without the consent of the donors, that
it be converted into a Lee Memorial Truslt Fund.
Mrs. McKinney stated there was a great deal of work
to be done in the chapel which she felt sure the donors of
the fund would like to do; or, if the fund were later avail-
able a project many had in mind could be carried out,
that of restoring the spot where General Lee, lay for
thirteen years before he was removed to the chapel.
Mrs. McDowell, of Alabama, spoke against the recom-
mendation, stating that last year they had been told op-
portunity would this year be given for discussion, and her
Division had voted to ask a return of its donations.
Mrs. Bashinsky, of Alabama, stated that as the money
had been donated for a special purpose, and that work
had not been carried out, the donations should be re-
turned.
Mrs. Hunt, of Missouri, stated that since the contribu-
tions had been given with one purpose in view, Missouri
requested that the money be returned.
Mrs. McKinney stated that the understanding was that
the Divisions report to the Committee; that a letter had
gone out asking each director to report but that few had
so reported.

Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, stated that had the Divi-
sions reported, the Committee would have known the
wish of the majority; that the recommendation should
not now be changed.
Mrs. Merchant, of Virginia, spoke in favor of the
recommendation, stating the delegates could not now
vote to consider the matter. Mrs. Hoover, of West Vir-
ginia, and Mrs. Boiling, of Virginia, spoke in favor of
the recommendation.
Mrs. Grace, of Georgia, spoke against the recommenda-
tion, stating that the Georgia Division asks the return of
the money contributed by her.
Mrs. Clay, of California, moved that we adopt the
recommendation. Carried.
Mrs. Canby, of Missouri, moved that the Lee Memorial
Chapel Committee, with its Directors, be continued.
Carried.
The Chair announced the report of the Committee,
"War Between the States," in order.
The Chairman, Mrs. R. Philip Holt, read the report of
the Committee, "War Between the States," which upon
motion was accepted.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON "THE WAR BETWEEN THE
STATES"
Madam President-General and Daughters:
When our President-General asked me to act as Chairman of this
Committee I felt that 1 was not the one for the place but I was will-
ing to do my best, which has been very little for in all of my work
for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, this is in truth the
most uphill and discouraging that I have ever undertaken.
In the first place, what can you expect the Committee to accom-
plish as long as our dear old Veterans and the members of our or-
ganization with few exceptions use the old term "Civil War."
This year I have written 3,569 letters, of which most of them were
to the newspapers and history teachers of our country.
While I wrote and asked each Division Director to report to me
what she had accomplished this year, I only heard from five and
1 want to thank those for at least trying. Several of the Georgia

Chapters reported they were doing their bit and hoped before long
to see some good come from their work, Mrs. Campbell of Vir-
ginia, spoke about our work at her Division Convention.
Our Director in Alabama, Mrs. Daugette, is using her influence
among the teachers of her State and with her I feel that is where
our work will count for most, for if we can get the children to use
the term"WAR BETWEEN THE STATES" in a few years it will
be accepted by all.
The Mississippi Director feels that it is needless to try to educate
the public.
North Carolina's Director, Mrs. Kirkman, has written each Chap-
ter in her Division placing before them our reasons for wanting
them to use this term and asking their co-operation in placing be-
fore the youth our reasons. Another small thing that Mrs. Kirkman
and your Chairman have been able to do is to bring to the atten-
tion of the proper person the inscription on a marker placed near
Durham, N. C., where Johnston and Sherman met to discuss the
terms of the final surrender of the forces of our Southland. The
inscription used was the term Civil War, but we have been assured
since their attention has been called to it, that it will be changed
to the term "WAR BETWEEN THE STATES."
While we feel that our work has accomplished very little, yet
we hope we have planted seed that will eventually bring forth much
fruit.
Respectfully submitted,
TEMPE WHITEHEAD HOLT, Chairman.
The Chair announced the report of the Committee,
Matthew Fontaine Maury Prize, in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Mrs. Robert Alter,
Mrs. Albert Sidney Porter read the following report,
which upon motion was accepted.
REPORT OF MAURY PRIZE COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and Ladies:
The Matthew Fontaine Maury Prize was awarded this year at
Annapolis to Midshipman John William Bays, of the Class of 1926.
He is a son of Lieutenant Colonel Bays, an instructor at Culver
Military Academy, Culver, Indiana.
As you know, this prize is given yearly at the United States
Naval Academy to a midshipman for excellence in physics. It con-
sists of a pair of Rausch& Lamb "Victory" Binoculars and is giv-
en by the Daughters in memory and appreciation of our great
scientist, Matthew Fontaine Maury, whose name should be, but is
not, in the Hall of Fame.
The customary inscription is on the glasses—on one side the
name of the recipient with the added words "From the United
-\

Daughters of the Confederacy," and on the other side, the words
"In Honor of Matthew Fontaine Maury, 'The Pathfinder of the
Seas.'"

The report of the Committee on Arlington Amphi-
theatre, was called for. None having been received, the
Chair announced the report of the Committee, Faithful
Slave Memorial in order.
In the absence of the Chairman, Mrs. Mary Dowling
Bond, Mrs. Roy Weaks McKinney read the following re-
port, which was accepted without its recommendation.
REPORT OF THE FAITHFUL SLAVE MEMORIAL COMMITTEE
Madam Chairman, Daughters and Friends:
This six-year-old Committee, which has had a nine thousand
pound Barre granite boulder ready to be set up for the past five
years and no place to set it, has very appropriately been called by
Mrs. Amos Norris, "The Wandering Jew Committee," and the name
is even more fitting since we have that modern Beelzebub driving
us amain, as effectively as it has, all Hooded and Shrouded, driven
the Democratic party on the reefs.
In 1920, Dr. Matthew Page Andrews' remark, that it would be
proper to mark the spot where Heyward Shepherd fell the first
victim in the John Brown raid at Harpers Ferry, as a tribute to
all faithful slaves, was adopted, and a joint committee of Daughters
of the Confederacy and Sons of Confederate Veterans named to
carry out the Memorial plan, each organization contributed $500.00,
the monument when set up not to exceed in price $1,000.00. Dr.
Matthew Page Andrews was selected to draft the inscription for
Memorial. The Peter Burghard Stone Company of Louisville, Ky.,
received the contract for the boulder and agreed to be paid when
the boulder had been set, and accepted by the committee; the
memorial was completed in summer of 1921, after a lapse of a
year and no available spot had been secured for the boulder and
the Stone Company was giving free storage, the joint committee
agreed to make a partial payment of $500.00, the remainder of the
amount is with the Treasurer of the Daughters of the Confederacy.
The inscription on the Memorial is,—"Here in the night of October
16th, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected colored
man, was mortally wounded by John Brown's raiders. In pur-
suance of his duties as watchman, he became the first victim of
the attempted insurrection. The negroes of this neighborhood,
true to their Christian training, would have no part with those who
offered pikes and staves for bloody massacre. This boulder is set
up by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of
Confederate Veterans as a Memorial to Heyward Shepherd.exempli-
fying the character and faithfulness of thousands of negroes who,
under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war,

so conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which
is the peculiar heritage of the American people and an everlasting
tribute to the best in both races."
At the time he was assassinated, Shepherd was a freedman in
the employ of the B. & O. Railroad as night watchman. For this
reason the Committee in seeking a site for the rugged boulder,
wrote to President Willard for permission to place the stone on a
triangular spot surrounded by a drive that is in front of the station
at Harpers Ferry. Mr. Williard's Secretary wrote that as the com-
pany had permitted the War Department, at the request of the
Antietam Battlefield Board, to set markers not far from this spot
in marking the battle lines of the Army of the Potomac and the
Army of Northern Virginia, the company would like for the or-
ganizations to get permission from the War Department. This was
procured, but over the signature of Assistant Secretary Wainwright,
the company preferred the signature of the Secretary of War; Mr.
Weeks very kindly subscribed. Next, the Railroad Company wrote
that there was objection to the memorial upon the part of the City
Council, a letter to the City Fathers brought the reply that there
was no racial sentiment there and that the monument might en-
gender such feeling.
Col. Braxton D. Gibson, Chairman for the Sons of Veterans,
who lives at Charles Town, W. Va., ten miles from Harpers Ferry,
wrote that the council would likely consent to the boulder if the
wording of the inscription was changed leaving, out the words
pikes and staves, and also the words BLOODY MASSACRE, to
make this change would slightly deface the inscription surface
and the next United Daughters of the Confederacy Convention
voted to have the committee try further for a site. In the effort
to procure plot it developed that the Recorder of the Council at
Harpers Ferry was the President of Storer College, a Negro Col-
lege endowed by a Massachusetts philanthropist, and that the Re-
corder was formerly a Massachusetts citizen.
In the past summer Col. Gibson wrote and requested "to be re-
leased from participating further in such an undertaking as would
be involved in securing a lot in Harpers Ferry in a proper loca-
tion and properly protected from injury."
Your chairman communicated to Dr. Galloway, Commander of
Sons, that his chairman had withdrawn and then the committee
report was drafted. Since then a letter came from Miss Orra Tom-
linson, member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy com-
mittee who also resides at Charles Town, W. Va., giving verbatim
a newspaper article that sheds considerable light on the situation,
the article follows—
"Harpers Ferry, W. Va., August 24th. (Special.) On the campus
of the Storer College grounds here is the fire engine house which
was seized by John Brown in his raid and which has been known
since as John Brown's Fort. Originally the building stood near
the station. It was shipped to the World's Fair in Chicago, but
was returned and restored, a tablet on this edifice bears this in-
scription: "That this nation might have a new birth of freedom,
that slavery should be removed forever from American soil, John
Brown and his twenty-one men gave their lives. To commemo-
rate their heroism, this tablet is placed on this building which
N

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 227
has since been known as John Brown's Fort. By the Alumni of
Storer College, 1918." Within the building which is open to the
public are many mementoes of Brown.
Besides the newspaper articles there is told an incident of a
woman who went into this building to learn just what relics there
were of John Brown. The first thing that caught her eye was an
iron collar with spikes, described as a thing the slaves were com-
pelled to wear around their necks, next was a pair of hand-cuffs
said to be placed upon slaves while plowing in the fields. The rel-
ics were such libelous canards, further inspection was not pur-
sued.
The information about the John Brown Fort has not been in the
hands of the chairman a week and the committee conference over
it.by letter, has not transpired. A suggestion has been made that
the boulder with an explanatory inscription on reverse side be
placed at Charles Town, W. Va. There is of course, the loop hole
for reopening the question with the Harpers Ferry Councihnen,
by offering to change the words of the inscription, these sugges-
tions! are mentioned for your discussion.
The placing of the Shepherd Memorial has an historical import
and HAS MADE more HISTORY in seeking a logical position, for
this reason the chairman for the Daughters makes three recom-
mendations:
1st. As the boulder seems destined to be deported from its
rightful city, that the next best contributive location be decided by
these authoritative persons, .Mr. Arthur Jennings, Historian for
Sons of Veterans, Mrs. St. J. A. John Lawton, Historian for Daugh-
ters of Confederacy, Dr. Matthew Page Andrews, United States
Historian Dr. W. C. Galloway, Commander Sons of Veterans and
the President-General of the Daughters of the Confederacy.
2nd. That if inscription is used on reverse of Boulder, Mr. An-
drews draft the inscription and the Daughters pay half the added
expense of having same incised.
3rd. Commander of Sons of Veterans be requested to delegate
one or more sons to secure rights of property as site after it has
been designated as the choice location. *
With the wish that the Thirty-Second United Daughters of the
Confederacy Convention may be magnatized with the iron and the
ozone of the Ozarks, and the confidence that if a moribund com-
mittee can gain relief anywhere in the world it must be this week
at Hot Springs, Arkansas, where there are present a host of Daugh-
ters, each one willing to have the Faithful Slave in healing
waters.

The Chairman, Mrs. Roy Weaks McKinney, read the
report, which upon motion was accepted, without its
recommendations.
REPORT OF THE MEMORIAL APPROACH TO
ARLINGTON COMMITTEE U. D. C.
This committee began early in the year to gather informatoin
about the great memorial bridge that is to "bind the North and
the South together in one indivisible union knowing no sectional
lines." This legislation has been advocated since Andrew Jack-
son was President of the United States, and Congress has on sev-
eral occasions passed laws pursuant to which preliminary plans
have been prepared for this bridge, but from lack of active pros-
ecution and definite action toward authorization the project has
been allowed to languish.
In 1913 a law was passed in the Public Buildings Act of March
4th, which provided that a commission be created to consist of
the President of the United States; the President of the Senate;
the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of
the committees on Public Buildings and Grounds of the Senate and
House of Representatives, for the purpose of investigating and
reporting to Congress. Nothing was done under this authoriza-
tion until nine years later when an appropriation was made in
the Executive and Independent Office Appropriation Act approved
June 12th, 1922. After the passage of this Act work was commenc-
ed on general plans and estimates for the proposed bridge and its
approaches and accessories with the result that on April 22nd,
1924, the President transmitted to Congress the preliminary plans
with report and recommendation of the Arlington Memorial Bridge
Commission.
This commission favors the immediate commencement of this
important and generally approved project under a ten year pro-
gram of construction with a total expenditure, in the ten year
period, of $14,750,000.
On December 30th. 1924, the Senate, without debate, passed a
bill providing for the construction of a $14,000,000 memorial
bridge across the Potomac River to the Virginia shore from a
point near the Lincoln Memorial.
Senator Claude A. Swanson of Virginia and Senator Bert M.
Fernald of Maine, introduced the bill. Under the terms of the
bill the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission is authorized to
proceed at once in the construction of the bridge including roads,
streets and walks leading to it on bath sides of the river. The
bill provides for annual expenditures in an estimated ten years
construction program.
With these facts as a working basis your committee appealed to
Senator Claude A. Swanson of Virginia for guidance and help and
received the following letter:
"I am in receipt of your letter of the first instant, which I have
noted. \


## p. 230 (#234) ############################################

230 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
After many years of effort we were able to secure the passage
of the bill authorizing the construction of the Memorial Bridge.
The authorized appropriation, which will amount to about $14,-
000,000 will cover a period of ten years. The money appropriated
so far is for the construction of some of the :piers and general
preliminary work, and it will be several years before the con-
struction of the bridge has advanced sufficiently to consider the
matters to which you refer in your letter. Nothing, therefore, can
be done in this connection at the present time.
You may rest assured I will keep in touch with the situation
and bear this matter fully in mind, and will communicate with
you at the proper time.
With kindest regards and best wishes, I am,
Sincerely yours,
CLAUDE A. SWANSON.
In consideration of the importance of this work the committee
recommends that the Memorial Approach to Arlington Committee
be continued and when the time is at hand for active effort, Di-
vision Directors be added to the Committee.
Work has been greatly facilitated by the assistance rendered by
Mrs. Frank Morrison, Mrs. Wallace Streater and Mrs. Cora Mil-
ward Armstrong, all of the District of Columbia. These ladies
have kept in close touch with the situation and have supplied
the committee with valuable data and all press reports. Their un-
failing interest and courtesy is here acknowledged with thanks.
The first pledge of financial support is recorded with appre-
ciation. It comes from Mrs. Cora Milw'ard Armstrong, and is ded-
icated to the memory of General Joseph Wheeler in appreciation
of the long friendship that has existed between General Wheeler
and the Armstrong family. The nature of the gift will be de-
cided upon later when building plans are developed.

report which upon motion was accepted.
REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF PAGES
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy:
It is a real pleasure to bring you this report for when our great-
ly loved President appointed me as Chairman of Pages, I just won-
dered if she knew that several times last year I was called for a
Page at Savannah and how very youthful it made me feel. So the
nicest thing she could do was to make me Chairman of Pages this
year.
The President-General furnished me the names of those she
had. honored to be her Pages.
I wrote to each Division President requesting names of their
Pages and upon receiving them wrote to each Page telling them
their costume, that it was a ruling made at the Tampa convention,
The responses from these young women have been most pleasant
and enthusiastic.
I regret there were several names reached . me too late for the
.program.
Mrs. Cooper, Vice Chairman of Pages, Mrs. Massey, of Hot
Springs, and Miss Lea, Local Chairmen of Little Rock, have given
their fullest co-operation. It has been delightful to be associated
with them, and a great pleasure of knowing and. serving with
these charming young girls it has been my good fortune to direct.

The Chairman, Miss Mary Poppenheim stated that as
she had understood the committee had been discontinued
she had no report, but would read a letter received from
Mme. de Courtivron.
REPORT ON THE AMERICAN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
AT NEUILLYSUR SEINE, FRANCE
At the request of our President-General, Mrs. Harrold, I am here
on this program to give you a brief summary of our work with
the American Memorial Hospital at Neuilly-sur Seine, France.
As you all know the United Daughters of the Confederacy Hos-
pital World War work has placed in the American Military Hos-
pital No. 1, which is the foundation of this New Memorial Hospi-
tal. I hold in my hand the circular issued by our War Relief
Committee, March 20th, 1919, which tells the story of the endow-
ment of the seventy beds at a cost of forty two thousand dollars
per annum which the United Daughters of the Confederacy sup-
ported in this Hospital—each one a memorial to some great Con-
federate leader, some group of Confederates or the descendants of
some Confederate Soldier or Sailor. When the corner stone for
the new American Memorial Hospital was laid in 1923, our War
Relief Chairman, Mrs. Rountree, was in Paris, and on invitation
from our American Embassador, Mr. Herrick, who was to lay the
Corner Stone, was allowed to place in that Corner Stone a copy
of this same circular with all that it tells of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy war work. Since the United Daughters of the
Confederacy had done so much for the American Military Hos-
pital No. 1, after the Armistice, Mrs. Robert Bacon, Chairman of
the work in America, urged Miss Poppenheim to request the United
Daughters of the Confederacy to continue their interest in its
successor which was to be an American Memorial to all members
of the A. E. F. who served and died in France. At the Birmingham
Convention in 1922, Miss- Poppenheim suggested that the United
Daughters of the Confederacy place an elevator in the New Hos-
pital as a "Memorial to men of Confederate descent in the A. E. F.
who died in France during the World War." This was undertak-
en and the United Daughters of the Confederacy sent to the Hos-
pital $2000.00 for their main elevator and a brass plate to be
placed in the Elevator recording the fact that the Elevator was
such a Memorial.
I asked the Marquise de Courtivron, who was the Vice-Chair-
man of the Committee on The Memorial Elevator, and who lives
only a block from the hospital, in fact, one can see its upper
stories from her garden, to go over to the Hospital last month and
send me a late word to tell you of the conditions there. This is
her reply:
"166 Bd. Bineau,
Neuilly-sur Seine,
Oct. 20th, 1925.
My Dear Miss Poppenheim:
Immediately on receipt of your letter I went over to the Amer-
ican Hospital and secured an appointment with the architect to

go over the new building. I was able to do this on October 15th,
and received the following data: During the drive for funds for
the completion of the Hospital $260,000 had been raised, about
$80,000 were still needed to complete the work. He hopes to
have the Hospital quite finished for the first of January, an im-
portant matter, as the authorities are daily obliged to refuse pa-
tients in the old building. Great activity was reigning the day I
visited the new Hospital, all the constructors and handicrafts had
been called together and work was everywhere in full swing.
The building is already heated and lighted, the operating rooms,
so to speak, finished and locked, and on October 15th twenty-five
nurses were to sleep in the finished ward at the top floor. Fur-
niture was being laid in and things taking on a quite homely
aspect. Leaving the wards we mounted to the roof garden where
patients will be able to lie out all day. The view there is beau-
tiful and reposing, on one side right across Paris to the church of
the Sacred Heart of Mont Martre which towers over the city—on
the other, over the Seine and the Gardens of Neuilly. The United
Daughters of the Confederacy Elevator will take patients up to
this terrace. The architect showed me the elevator on the ground
floor and the authorities voiced their appreciation of the Daugh-
ters' gift. Miss Ware, .in the old Hospital, was kind enough to
give me the statistics of Southern patients treated there in 1924
up to date; she would have procured names too, to interest friends,
but time failed. I am writing a long letter tomorrow and posting
this in haste.
Sincerely your friend,
AGNES de COURTIVRON.

Nurses has graduated 42 nurses trained in American methods in
(the past seven years and most of these nurses are practicing in
Paris today. 836 patients were treated in the old Hospital in 1924
and 1951 patients were treated outside the Hospital. The Direc-
tresses of Nurses, Miss Hannan and Miss Savage are graduates of
the Presbyterian Hospital in New York. Last year the hospital
spent in its up-keep fifity two thousand dollars and by its char-
ter granted in 1913 by act of Congress and approved by President
Taft it cannot operate for profit.
The new Hospital which houses our United Daughters of the
Confederacy Elevator will cost over a .million dollars, and will
provide for the care of 120 patients; a vast improvement over the
original one which could only care for 32. Still, though small, it
was a mighty force. Now with the new Hospital it provides a list
of accredited physicians, surgeons and specialists who are ex-
tended the courtesy of the hospital and no stricken American in
Paris need depend on unreliable strangers for directions for med-
ical care. While the number of patients admitted to the hospital
must be limited, it reaches out and protects and helps Americans
who are ill, even if they do not need hospital service. Every
mention in the Paris New York Herald of gifts to the Hospital
that are memorials contains the notice of the United Daughters

of the Confederacy's gift of "A special memorial Elevator in Mem-
ory of those men of Confederate descent in the A. E. F. who died
in France during the World War."
Thus are the United Daughters of the Confederacy constantly
mentioned in the life of this vital force in American life in this
great European center. Perhaps you may ask why think of this
in connection with our United Daughters of the Confederacy
work? Do we not want to touch the life of the world with our
Organization's influence? Can we do it, if they do not know of our
existence? This notice may be of use to you or some of your
dear ones.
"If you fall ill while in Europe don't take the rec-
ommendation of an employe or irresponsible stranger.
If in Paris, telephone the American Hospital, which,
without charge, will recommend a reliable physician.
If elsewhere, either consult the American Consul or
telegraph the American Hospital, 44 rue Chauveau-
Neuilly."
You may say if this misfortune shall befall me how can one
get into this Hospital? First. All Americans, including women
of American birth and their children, are eligible to the use of
the hospital if there is a vacancy.
Second. Show your passport and it will admit you.
Third. Contageous diseases or mental cases requiring restraint
are not admitted.
Fourth. Chronics may not remain longer than three months.
Fifth. Ward cases are treated by the hospital physicians, users
of private rooms employ their own physician if he is on the ac-
credited list furnished by the hospital.
Mrs. Beal, our first Vice-President-General, tells me she visited
this hospital this past summer and was well pleased that our Me-
morial Elevator is placed in such a desirable institution.
Our work in this Hospital during the War was very different
from the record we read here in 1924. The distance in time be-
tween the two records seems very great, but the need for Hos-
pital service is the same. Our special need when stricken in a
foreign land seems to fill the whole world and so the comfort of
the service is equally important.
May none of us here ever need the American Memorial Hospital's
service, but let us be glad that we have helped in a small measure
to provide its helping resources to many of our own people
stricken in a strange land.
MARY B. POPPENHEIM.
Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, spoke in grateful praise
of the hospital as it had been of such signal service to
her and her husband at the time of his illness in Paris.

The Chair announced the report of the Committee, The
Designer of the Stars and Bars in order.
The Chairman, The Historical-General, Mrs. St. John
A. Lawton, read the report of that Committee, which was
accepted without its recommendation.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DESIGNER " STARS AND BARS"
Madam President and Members of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy:
It is the judgment of your Committee after hearing all evidence
submitted to date, that the reasonable supposition is in favor of
the claim of Orrin Randolph Smith, as the designer of the Con-
federate Flag, "The Stars and Bars."
In justice to all parties we recommend—
That any evidence which may be submitted to this Organization
in the future, shall be put in the hands of an unbiased, trained re-
search worker for an opinion as to the value of such evidence.
Said person not to be connected with any Confederate organiza-
tion.
(Signed) Mrs. St. J. A. Lawton,
(Signed) Decca Lamar West,
(Signed) Mrs. Jno. L. Woodbury,
(Signed) Mrs. George Gill,
The recommendation was then read. Mrs. Anderson of
North Carolina moved its adoption. Seconded.
Mrs. Cory, of Alabama, was given the privilege of the
floor. She stated she wished first to thank the Conven-
tion for the courtesy extended the two Alabama chapters
present but without the authority to vote; and to ask that
action on the recommendation presented by the commit-
tee on Designer of the Stars and Bars be postponed until
she had been given further opportunity to duplicate proof
of the claim of Mr. Marshall as the designer, such infor-
mation having been burned in a fire which destroyed her
house last summer.
The Treasurer-General, Mrs. Higgins, stated the
committee had been appointed to pass upon information
which had been presented and not on proof which might
or might not be received in the future.

236 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Miss West, of Texas, stated that the sense of the com-
mittee was that from testimony so far received, and a
distinct weight of evidence, proved Mr. Smith as the de-
signer of the flag; but always wanting to be just, it was
felt that should any further proof be brought forward at
any time, it would not be disbarred, but at the same time
the committee felt the question well settled.
Mrs. Massey, of Arkansas, stated she would be in favor
of the recommendation if the committee would eliminate
the words "reasonable supposition" and bring in a defi-
nite report so that the matter would be a closed incident.
Mrs. Schuyler spoke in favor of a definite report so
that a member could, when asked who designed the flag,
be authorized to say that the United Daughters of the
Confederacy had endorsed the claim of one person.
Mrs. Henderson stated that as the truth of history was
one of the distinct purposes of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy she thought it wise to leave the matter
open for further proof.
Mrs. Schuyler moved to recommit. Seconded by Mrs,
Wright.
Mrs. Swartwout, of Massachusetts, spoke against the
motion, suggesting striking out the words "reasonable
supposition."
Mrs. McKinney spoke against striking out anything if
the evidence had not been entirely convincing, and spoke
in favor of recommitting.
The motion to recommit was lost.
Miss West, of Texas, moved that in view of the seeming
misunderstanding the committee be allowed to have a
meeting and report back at the evening session.
Mrs. Woodbury, of Kentucky, stated that because posi-
tive proof had not reached the committee the words
"reasonable supposition" had been used; that the weight

of evidence and affidavits all pointed toward establishing
the claim of Mr. Orrin Randolph Smith, but there was
no proof of official adoption of his design by the Con-
federate Government.
Mrs. Schuyler moved to recommit. Seconded by Mrs.
Faris. Carried.
The Chair announced the report of the Committee
Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, in order.
The Chairman, Mrs. Livingston Rowe Schuyler, read
the report of the Committee, Thomas Jefferson Memorial
Foundation, which upon motion was accepted.
THOMAS JEFFERSON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION COMMITTEE
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy:
This report is a letter from the President of Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation, Inc. Mr. Stuart G. Gibboney.
"Since December 1, 1923, when legal title to Monticello became
vested in the Foundation and the Foundation took possession of
the property, a great deal has been accomplished toward the com-
plete restoration of Monticello. Up to and including August 31,
1925, the Foundation actually paid out the total sum of $321,100.82
strictly and solely on account of the purchase, insurance, interest,
repairs and maintenance of Monticello.
It is hoped by the end of next year to completely free the prop-
erty of debt and raise as much of the $500,000 Endowment Fund
as possible. The Foundation is now issuing Jefferson Centennial
Certificates to all those who contribute $1.00 or more to the fund
for Monticello. These Certificates are handsomely lithographed,
size 15 inches by 18 inches, and suitable for framing. The name
of each donor is iserted in the Certificate, the body of which is
super-imposed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence
showing all the original signatures thereto and making a very
beautiful souvenir of the Jefferson Centennial and the coincident
Sesqui-Centennial of the Declaration of Independence.
A special message will be issued by Mr. Breckinridge Long,
former Under-Secretary of State, as Chairman of the National
Jefferson Centennial Committee, suggesting that Thanksgiving Day
this year be observed, if possible, as a patriotic thanksgiving when
all citizens may express their thanksgiving for the liberty and in-
stitutions which we enjoy in this country.
In cooperation with the patriotic societies and our Jefferson
Centennial Committees and also with the National Educational
Committee appointed by the Foundation, we hope to arrange for
a PATRIOTIC WEEK. We plan to make that period the oppor-

tunity for a nation-wide patriotic revival not only through our
committees of adults but through all the school children.
We will also plan an occasion in 1926 as part of the observance
of the Jefferson Centennial to publicly dedicate Monticello to the
children of America as a Patriotic Shrine. As these plans develop
we shall keep you advised as we have heretofore and I assure
you that we are deeply grateful to the United Daughters of the
Confederacy for their splendid cooperation. At all times we wel-
come your counsel and assistance and shall pride ourselves in re-
taining your continued interest in our work.
I cannot close this report without adding the statement that
during the months of May and June of this.year the Albemarble
Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in Char-
lottesville, Va., acted upon the invitation of the Foundation as
the official hostesses at Monticello, considerably to the credit of
both the Foundation and your organization.
Special commendation is due from the Foundation to you, Mrs.
Schuyler and also Mrs. Norman V. Randolph, Mrs. Bennett D.
Bell, Mrs. James Stuart Fitzhugh of Charlottesville, Va., Mrs. Ca-
bell Smith of Charlotte, N. C., and Mrs. C. Marshall Mitchell of
Cincinnati, Ohio, for (their splendid efforts in behalf of Monti-
cello."

Chairman.
The Chair announced the report of the Committee on
Official Ribbon in order
The Chairman, Mrs. W. N. C. Merchant read the report,
which upon motion was accepted without its recommen-
dations.
REPORT COMMITTEE ON OFFICIAL RIBBON
The first record that your Committee has found of the use of
Official Ribbons was at the Washington Convention, 1912, a par-
agraph on page 83 of the minutes of this Convention reads as fol-
lows: "Mrs Marshall Williams called attention to the ribbons
worn about the neck of the General Officers and Division Presi-
dents, the idea of Mrs. Marion Butler, and moved that the idea be
adopted at all future Conventions. Carried."
However there was no established rule for the manner of wear-
ing the ribbons, no regulations as to width, design, or style of
ribbon, until the Tampa Convention, 1919, the ribbons worn at
this Convention were selected by Miss Mary B. Poppenheim, then
President-General, they were endorsed by the Executive Com-
mittee and adopted by the Convention, as Were also the number
of Pages for the President-General, the number of Division Pages,
and Pages for Chapters in States where there are no Divisions,
and the costumes for all Pages. These ribbons and costumes were

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 239
ratified by ;the Convention in Asheville, 1920, and the recommen-
dation of the Executive Committee adopted to the effect that the
ribbons and costumes be continued until changed by the Execu-
tive Committee, no action has been taken since that time.
The ribbons, and costumes for Pages adopted by the Tampa
Convention are as follows:
Ribbons for General Officers, two and one half inches in width,
satin; red, white and red, stripes of equal width, worn over the
right shoulder-and tied on left hip, except the ribbon for Presi-
dent-General, which shall be worn about the neck with President-
General insignia pendant therefrom.
Ribbons for Division Presidents, one and one-half inches in
width, gros-grain, red and white and red, stripes of equal width,
worn in like manner as General Officers.
Pages for President-General to be ten in number, these to wear
on opening evening of Convention and when on duty, white skirts
with red blouses, with ribbons four inches in width, white, with
the words "Page to President-General" printed in red.
All Divisions and Chapters in States where there are no Di-
visions to have two Pages, these as well as the local Pages (the
number of local Pages to be unlimited) to wear on the opening
evening of Convention and when on duty white dresses with red
ribbons four inches in width, printed in black with the word
"Page."
Ribbons for Pages to be worn pendant from right shoulder. In
1922 ribbons were selected for the ex-Presidents-General, these
are two and one-half inches in width, center of red, one and one-
fourth inches, with one-eighth inch of white on each side, remain-
ing width, equal widths of white and red moire.
A sample of this ribbon was sent the manufacturer, the ribbon
is woven on a hand loom; we were promised an exact reproduc-
tion, but the ribbon furnished is a shade lighter than that pre-
viously used, however, since it is the exact shade of ribbons used
by other officers, it was with the approval of the President-Gen-
eral, accepted.
There! have been no ribbons for these women whom we delight
to honor our Honorary Presidents; the Chairman of this Com-
mittee, requested Miss Poppenheim, who had selected the ribbons
adopted at Tampa to suggest a design for these officers, and we
recommend the ribbon suggested as follows:
That ribbons for the Honorary Presidents, be two and one-half
inches in width, moire, centre of red, one and one-half inches,
edges of white one-half inch, worn in like manner as IGeneral Of-
ficers.;
We further recommend that all ribbons, except those for local
pages, be furnished by the general organization and supplied by
the Second Vice-President-General, and that the information as
to where they are to be obtained be printed in the Minutes under
"General Instructions."
Respectfully submitted,
MAUDE B. MERCHANT, Chairman.

The Second Vice-President-General, Mrs. W. C. N. Mer-
chant, spoke of a design for a medal similar to that al-
ready adopted, of smaller size and less expensive, some-
thing to wear informally and to give as prizes, and moved
that this medal be recommended to chapters and indi-
viduals wishing to offer a less expensive medal than the
one on sale. Seconded by Mrs. Massey.
After some discussion as to whether the patent on the
larger medal would cover the smaller one, Mrs. McKinney
moved to amend by adopting the recommendation sub-
ject to reply received from the Patent Office.
Mrs. Henderson moved to amend the amendment by
adding the Custodian of Medals be instructed to have the
patent cover both medals. Mrs. McKinney accepted the

Amendment proposed by Virginia Division:
Amend Article 7, Section 5, of by-laws of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy by adding the following:
"Any appeal for sums of $10,000 and over, having been endorsed
by the Executive Committee and presented to an Annual Conven-
tion of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, shall be sub.'-
mitted for ratification or rejection to the State Division and to
Chapters where there are no divisions, a majority vote being
necessary for final adoption."
The Historian-General, Mrs. Lawton, stated that the
word "endorsed" gave the Executive Committee too much
power and suggested substituting therefor the word "sub-
mitted."
Mrs. Boiling, of Virginia, moved to amend by striking
out the word "endorsed by" and substituting therefor
"submitted to." Carried.
Mrs. Lawton moved to amend by striking out the word

COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS
Madam President-General, Daughters of the Confederacy, espec-
ially the Arkansas Daughters:
From the moment the invitation of the Arkansas Daughters was
accepted last November to "Come to Hot Springs," the Daughters
of every Division have looked forward with eager anticipation
to the day when their visit would begin in this unusual State,
with its remarkable resources. Our expectations have been great,
but never for one second did we dream that a welcome, studded
with pearls and diamonds awaited us.
From the time of our arrival we have felt the warmth of this
welcome. Mrs. Lora Goolsby, President of the Division, Mrs.
Stephen E. Dillon, local Chairman of the Convention Committee,
Mrs. W. E. Massey and their co-workers have left nothing undone
that could add to either the comfort or pleasure of their guests.
Unbounded admiration is felt for them. They have "put over"
the Convention in fine style and to them we tender sincerest
thanks and most heartfelt appreciation.
To the Division Hostesses we are indebted for many, many
thoughtful acts and courtesies, they seeming to anticipate our
every want and wish.
The gracious expressions of greeting on opening evening made
us realize the enormity of our welcome into your midst and for
these kind words we are deeply appreciative. Especially do we
feel the privilege of having been welcomed by Arkansas' Gov-
ernor and we wish to thank him for the very appropriate words
he spoke on that occasion.

244 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Again on Wednesday evening, when was tendered the beautiful
reception, were the guests made to realize more forcibly the cor-
diality and hospitality of the people of this great State.
For the dinner to the Division Presidents, with all its elegant
appointments and attractive ceremonies, the luncheons with their
interesting features, the delightful drives over your picturesque
city, the charming teas and receptions and for all the other so-
cial affairs arranged for our pleasure, we desire to express our
unbounded thanks. The Convention feels they have never been
more royally entertained. Profound expressions of happiness and
contentment have been heard on all sides from guests assembled
here and we would that we could express this in part to our gra-
cious hostesses.
Arkansas is truly a wonder State and Hot Springs a wonder
City, unsurpassed.
To the Bishop and clergy, who have given us their prayers, to
the sweet singers and musicians who have inspired us with their
selections, to the Pages who have attended us so patiently and
faithfully, we would extend our sincerest thanks.
The Hotel Management is deserving of every nice thing we could
say. Every consideration and courtesy has been shown and ev-
erything done to make us comfortable.
To the Executive Committee, our Parliamentarian and Stenog-
rapher, we wish to express thanks for their untiring zeal and the
earnestness displayed in the discharge of their duties.
The Press has been most kind and obliging and we desire to
extend thanks to the representatives for their patience and kind-
ness.
In her sweet, lovable way, the President-General has endeared
herself to us all and her graciousness and personality have been
very large factors in making this Convention such a tremendous
success. We would have her name placed high up on our "Thank
You" list.
We desire to express our appreciation to all those who have
contributed to our pleasure and enjoyment and to say we have
had a perfectly splendid time in Hot Springs*
All promises made to us in Savannah have been kept, most re-
markable though they were. It seemed hardly probable that the
"Fountain of Youth," long sought, would be discovered in Hot
Springs, but a review of the splendid achievements of this Con-
vention is most convincing proof that the members of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy have taken long, deep draughts of
its exhilarating waters.

of the day be read. There being but a partial report
prepared, none was read.
The Historian-General, Mrs. Lawton, read the majority
report of the Committee on Designer of the Stars and
Bars as follows:
Madam President and United Daughters of the Confederacy:
It is the judgment of the majority of your Committee, after
hearing all evidence submitted to date, that the claim of
Orrin Randolph Smith, as the designer of the Confederate Flag,
"Stars and Bars," is sustained.

and stated there was also a minority report.
Mrs. Woodbury, of Kentucky, stated that having just
been elected to the office of Historian-General she felt it
her duty not to subscribe to anything not fully established
and asked that she be permitted to submit a minority re-
port:
Madam President-General and Members of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy:
As a member of the Committee on Designer of the Flag—Stars
and Bars, I beg to submit a minority report.
It does not appear to me that it has been proven which man's
design was finally accepted by the Confederate Government.
Therefore it does not seem to me that the claim of either con-
testant has been established.
Respectfully submitted,
CHARLOTTE O. WOODBURY.
Mrs. Woodbury moved to substitute the minority for
the majority report. The Treasurer-General, Mrs. Hig-
gins, spoke in favor of the majority report, stating the
committee had had before it all the evidence obtainable
and its findings should be sustained.

ington, spoke in favor of the minority report, stating that

the committee, the Daughters should postpone action.
Mrs. Lawton, Miss West and Schuyler spoke in favor
of the majority report, stating that all the evidence and

Associated Press, Atlanta, Georgia, commending the con-
stant attendance and fine work of Mr. Douglas War-
renfels, in reporting this Convention. Carried.

committee shall have charge of the Mrs. Simon Baruch Prize and
similar prizes given by the United Daughters of the Confederacy,
shall arrange all details of awarding these and any method of
co-operating with Divisions which in the judgment of the com-
mittee might seem desirable.
Mrs. Schuyler then moved to amend the amendment by
substituting the following:
"The Committee on Awarding the Mrs. Simon Baruch University
Prize shall consist of three members, whose duties are to arrange
for the awarding of the prize from the Memorial Fund. This
Committee shall arrange all details and shall report to the Con-
vention."
Seconded by Mrs. Higgins. Carried.
The proposed amendments to the Constitution of the
Children of the Confederacy, Article III, Sections 1 and

who sang Carolina.
Mrs. Lawton praised the singers and the song and
asked that Mrs. Lockwood be assured of her apprecia-
tion.
Mrs. Schuyler moved a vote of thanks to the splendid
artists. Carried.
The proposed amendment to Article IV, Section 4, was
then read.
Amendment proposed by Mrs. J. P. Higgins, Treasurert-General.

ed with the Registrar-General" and inserting, "the Chapter has re-
ceived Chapter dues upon every member so claimed and provided
further that every member claimed shall have been registered
with the Registrar-General," so that the section as amended shall

seven members, and one vote for every additional twenty-five
members, provided the per capita tax has been paid for the num-

ber of members upon which the vote is estimated, and the Chap-
ter has received Chapter dues upon every member so claimed and
provided further that every member claimed shall have been regis-
tered with the Registrar-General."
Mrs. Bashinsky, of Alabama, moved to amend by in-
serting the words "by each member upon whom" so that
the amendment would read.
Each Chapter shall be entitled, in all Conventions of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy, to one vote for the first
seven members and one vote for every additional twenty-five
members, provided the per capita tax has been paid by each
member upon whom the vote is estimated, and provided the
chapter has received chapter dues from every member so claimed;
and provided further that every member claimed shall have been
registered with the Registrar-General.
Mrs. McKinney spoke in favor of the amendment, stat-
ing it safe-guarded the membership of the organization.
After some discussion as to discrepancies in the figures
of the Registrar-General and those of the Treasurer-
General, and the desirability of being in a position to
know the exact membership of the organization, the
amendment was carried.
The proposed amendment as amended was carried.
The proposed amendment to Article V, Section 7, was
then read.
Amendment proposed by Mrs. J. P. Higgins, TreasurernGeneral.
Amend Article V, Section 7 (page 371, Savannah Minutes), by
substituting: "The Treasurer-General shall be the financial agent
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She shall receive
and receipt for all monies of the General Organization. She shall
keep (1) a cash book, and (2) a ledger, in which shall be entered
all accounts. Her books, papers, etc., shall be subject to inspec-
tion of the General Officers and the Finance Committee. She shall
make a report of the condition of her department at each Annual
Convention and monthly to the President-General and Chairman
of the Finance Committee, showing receipts and expenditures,
with the balance remaining on hand. She shall deposit the money
of the General Organization in the name of 'The United Daughters
of the Confederacy' per the Treasurer-General in some National
Bank, member of the Federal Reserve System, designated by the
Executive Committee, to be paid only upon her check when coun-
tersigned by the President-General or in the absence of the Presi-
dent-General, by the Vice-Presidents-General in order of their
rank. She shall keep all bonds, notes and securities in a Safe
Deposit Box in the name of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy. No change: She shall, sixty days before the meeting

paid within thirty days before the Annual Convention, those
Chapters will bet debarred representation in the Convention. She
shall prepare and send to the Chairman of the Credentials Com-
mittee, five days before the Convention, an alphabetical list,

foster the educational interests of this organization; to secure
from divisions reports of their education work, and from these
reports to prepare a condensed statistical report at each Annual
Convention; to receive and distribute scholarships for the benefit

Mrs. Lawton read her proposed amendment to Article
IX, Section 4.
Amendment proposed by Mrs. St. John A. Lawton. Historian-
General:
Amend Article IX, by adding Section 4 and Section 5, namely:
Section 4. The use of the name United Daughters of the Con-
federacy by any individual, Chapter or Division for any purpose
•whatsoever without the prefixing of the local designation of the
Chapter or Division is prohibited. Such misuse of the name
United Daughters of the Confederacy shall subject the individual,
Chapter or Division to suspension from membership in the or-
ganization for such period of time as the Executive Committee
shall determine.
The First Vice-President-General, Mrs. J. T. Beal was
called to the Chair at this point.
Mrs. Byrne, of West Virginia, spoke against the amend-
ment as suspension seemed too drastic, and moved to
amend by striking out the last sentence.
Mrs. Woodbury, of Kentucky, moved to amend the
amendment by adding the words "reprimand or" before
the word "suspension."
Mrs. Harrold, of Georgia, stated that while she agreed
with Mrs. Lawton that there should be some penalty for
misusing the name of the organization, she thought sus-
pension too drastic.
Miss Susan Davis, of New York, spoke against the
amendment, stating one could not penalize without
something criminal having occurred, and many members
and chapters were the victims of newspaper notices.
After some further discussion as to the misuse of the
name of the organization, the amendment to the amend-
ment was lost; the amendment to the proposed amend-
ment was lost; and the proposed amendment was lost.
Mrs. Lawton then read her proposed amendment to
Article IX, Section 5:
Article IX, Section 5. The use of the name, insignia and badge
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy by an individual,
Chapter or Division during their period of suspension from
membership in the organization for any purpose is prohibited.

252 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Disregard of this provision of these by-laws shall require the
Executive Committee to deprive the offending individual, Chapter
or Division from membership in the organization.
Mrs. Henderson, of Mississippi, spoke in favor of the
amendment, stating an incorporated body had the right
to protect itself.
Mrs. Lanier, of Connecticut, stated that such proposed
protection would seem to indicate the Daughters were
losing sight of the spirit of the organization, and urged
rather the bringing forward the ideals and leaving the
result to the leadership of the women.
The Treasurer-General, Mrs. Higgins, spoke in favor
of the amendment, citing the Colonial Dames as demand-
ing for proper and proven reasons the surrender of the
badge.
Upon request of Mrs. Schuyler, Mrs. Ludlow, of the
District of Columbia, was given the floor and stated she
had just been through a year of suspension, and felt that
this amendment was absolutely necessary.
The proposed amendment was adopted.
Mrs. Woodliff then read her proposed amendment to
Article V, Section 12 and moved to amend by substituting
therefor:
"No salary shall be paid to any officer of the organization
For clerical help in each of the offices of Recording Secretary-
General and Treasurer-General the sum of $250 per annum, and
to the Registrar-General, $750 per annum shall be appropriated,
said sums to be paid by these officers semi-annually."
Seconded by Mrs. White.
The substitute amendment was adopted.
The proposed amendment to Article VIII, Section 3,
was read.
Article VIII, Section 3. "A member of a disbanded or extinct
Chapter may obtain membership in another Chapter, to which she
may be acceptable, by presenting a certificate signed by the Presi-
dent and Treasurer of said Chapter, stating that said Chapter is

disbanding, and that the above member is in good standing, with
all dues paid to date, and is recommended for membership in any
Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to which
she may be acceptable."
Mrs. Porter of Ohio and Mrs. Higgins, of Missouri, spoke
in favor of the proposed amendment.
The amendment was adopted as read.
Mrs. Parker, of New York, read her proposed amend-
ment to Article IX, Section 2.
Amendment proposed by Mrs. James Henry Parker, New York:
Amend Article 9, Section 2, as follows: After the words: "This
badge may be suspended from a bar to designate the State," add
"and shall be attached to a red, white and red ribbon, and worn
only over the left breast at the United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy meetings, and on such other occasions as are worthy of its
display."
Reason.—That all other patriotic organizations wear their in-
signia suspended from a ribbon, and it befits the rank and dignity
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to do likewise.
Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, spoke in favor of the re-
quirement that the badge be worn on the left breast, and
moved to amend by striking out the words "and shall be
attached to a red, white and red ribbon." Carried.
Mrs. Merchant spoke against the proposed amendment,
stating she found from the sales of the past year that
a majority favored the badge as originally adopted.
The roll of states was called, the result showing the
proposed amendment as amended adopted by a unani-
mous vote.
Mrs. Holt, of North Carolina, offered the following
resolution, from the State of North Carolina, which upon
motion was adopted:
WHEREAS, The Convention assembled in Savannah, 1924,
adopted a resolution looking towards endowing a fellowship at
Randolph Macon Woman's College, Lynchburg, Virginia, value
$5,000, to be known as "The Cornelia Branch Stone Fellowship."
Be It Resolved: That this Convention appropriate $2500, from
such funds as may be available for this purpose.

Be It Resolved: That the Divisions and Chapters be requested
to forward contributions promptly, so that the first student may
enter in the Fall of 1926.
Mrs. Kolman stated that after hearing the report of the
little chapter in Paris, she felt that every one would feel
an interest in a motion to pay the debt on the monument
in Louisiana, and moved that there be taken from the
General Treasury the deficit for that monument, that we
may liquidate the debt in recognition of the services of
General de Polignac, adding that the deficit is $457.90,
and that her motion had been approved by the Executive
and Finance Committees. Seconded by Mrs. Schuyler.
Carried.
Mrs. Blenner, of Virginia, exhibited a Confederate flag
sent by Mrs. Randolph, calling attention to its dimensions,
as approved by the Confederate Veterans, and recom-
mended its use by the United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy, stating the firm of Annin & Company is the author-
ity on flags. Mrs. Blenner moved that the United Daugh-
ters of the Confederacy concur in the request of Mrs.
Randolph. Carried.
Miss Davis, of New York, spoke of the removal of her
book, "Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan 1866-77,"
from the shelves of Southern Authors in the Southern
Exposition in New York; of the reason given therefor—
that the United Daughters of the Confederacy had or-
dered its removal—and asked that the organization dis-
claim any such action.
The President-General read a letter of the Executive
Committee addressed to Miss Davis on that subject ask-
ing that the matter be brought to the President-General
in writing.
Miss Davis moved that the United Daughters of the
Confederacy say that they did not have anything to do
with removing her book from the shelves of the Southern
Exposition. Seconded by Mrs. Parker. Lost.

Mrs. Walke, of Virginia, asked if there might not be
some action taken to stop Admiral Wright from collect-
ing money in the name of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy. Mrs. McKinney told of his effort to canvass
Paducah and of having brought the matter to the atten-
tion of the authorities and he moved out of town; and
advised this action as a way to discredit his activities.
Mrs. Bashinsky, of Alabama, moved that the Daughters
disclaim all connection with the efforts of Admiral
Wright to raise money in the name of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy by the sale of flags or any
other method. Seconded by Mrs. Walke. Carried.
Mrs. Tompkins, of Louisiana, presented the claim of
the restoration of the home of Judah P. Benjamin for
sympathetic endorsement, and asked that this convention
go on record as endorsing the Judah P. Benjamin Memo-
rial Association in restoring his home at Belle Chasse,
without financial support. Carried.
The Becording Secretary-General, Mrs. Smith, stated
that the Executive Committee had approved the book-
plate designed by Mrs. John L. Woodbury, and en-
dorsed by the Committee on Endorsement of Books, and
recommended its adoption.
Mrs. Schuyler, of New York, moved that the recom-
mendation of the Executive Committee be sustained.
Carried.
The Chair announced the installation of newly elected
and re-elected officers in order.

DIVISION REPORTS
ALABAMA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confedera-
cy in Convention Assembled:
The great honor and pleasure has been given me to bring to you
the love and greetings from nearly five thousand loyal United
Daughters of the Confederacy of the Alabama Division. I wish it
were ten thousand instead of five, and it should be. A new face
to some of you—a new office to me—but not a new love or a new
work (Like Washington tho, I feel that if this honor could have
been bestowed on me in earlier days much more could be accom-
plished), and I am throwing my all, both love and pbysical
strength, into it, hoping to accomplish a great deal during the com-
ing year. Our cause is more alive now and there seems to be more
enthusiasm and interest in every phase of the work than ever
before.
I shall simply try to give you a resume of pur past years work—
gleaned from the reports given at our Annual meeting of the Di-
vision last May.
The meeting was held in a splendid suburb of our great Birm-
ingham, our hostess being the R. D. Jackson Chapter—Mrs. R. B.
Broyles, President. A large number of delegates were present and
the Convention was helpful in the business sessions, and delight-
ful in the many social features.
Membership
Nearly five hundred new members have been added to our roll
during this year. This was brought about through prizes which
were offered by individuals to chapters for the greatest number
added to their membership. Mrs. R. B. Broyles, President of the
Hostess Chapter, for the second time won the Division President's
prize and Mrs. Marion Scott of Headland, Mrs. Cook's prize for
gaining the greatest number of members between the ages of 18
and 25. Also we have found an Extension Committee, with its
four sub-divisions, North, South, East and West, wonderful help
in organizing new Chapters, since it is impossible for the Presi-
dent to visit all parts of the State in a year. They have organized
two new Chapters during this last year and have others in a form-
ative state, soon to be admitted.
We are also proud of the increase in numbers of our Children of
the Confederacy. This organization grew wonderfully the past
year under Mrs. E. Louis Crew. She organized 12 new chapters
and 261 new members have been added. Only through these can
the Daughters' organization live and thrive. Mrs. Gustave Mertens

is the new Director, and we know the work will progress splen-
didly under her leadership.
Veterans
The Veterans are our first—last—and all time care and love,
therefore, "The Soldiers Home Committee" is our first Standing
Committee, and truly 'tis first in thought and in our hearts and
first in our Treasury. This Committee, still headed by our much
loved Mrs. J. H. Crenshaw, not only sees that the men and women
in "the Home" are supplied with necessities, but luxuries. Social
life is given them in the way of parties and entertainments, birth-
day celebrations, etc., and all who are physically able are chape-
roned to the Annual Veterans meeting. Our Chapter Presidents are
being made honorary members of the Veterans' Camps now, with
the privileges of attending their meetings and helping in them. The
reader was honored this spring by being elected honorary member
of the Wilcox Camp of Birmingham, and it was her pleasure to at-
tend one of these meetings, which she enjoyed very much. We
noticed in the retiring President's report the sad fact that over
500 veterans had been transferred to their Heavenly Home within
the past year, and many more this year. Still at their State Re-
union in Tuscaloosa in October, there were registered over 400.
We were delighted at this meeting to shake hands with so many
vigorous ones. One Veteran from Montgomery, hale and hearty
looking, able to dance with us was only 104 years old. On the in-
coming President of the Division, was bestowed the honor of serv-
ing as Matron of Honor on General M. B. Houghton's and Col. Hal
Walker's staff. This reunion was said to be one of their very
best. All of these dear Veterans live from one reunion to another,
for here, they have the chance of reminiscing with each other,
which brings more happiness into their lives. They are counting
the days now until their general reunion, which we are so hanpy to
announce will be held in our own Birmingham. Just here I must
pause to relate the sad news of the death of General M. B. Hough-
ton, head of the Tennessee Department. He was stricken with
paralysis, Monday after the reunion at his house in Montgomery,
Alabama, and three days later he passed away. Though very fee-
ble, he took part with happy interest in every feature of this State
reunion. Another one of our leaders has answered the roll call in
Heaven. A cherished thought is that at the last General Reunion,
the Director had the honor and privilege of presenting to Gen.
Houghton, a "Cross of Honor" through the retiring President.
Alabama Division still observes the 26th of April as the Veterans'
specific Memorial Day, and every chapter has united in promising
that no Veteran's grave shall go unmarked another year. Our slo-
gan this year is "The Veterans First," then true History of the
Confederacy to be placed especially in our public schools. We
must see that the history is true in textbooks. Having SDent all of
my life among school people, I know it is not the teachers fault,
but the fault of the books they have to teach. So we Daughters of
the Confederacy must take up our cause with the Text Book Com-
mission and the School Boards. The only way now that our
chapters in Alabama can touch the child is through gifts of true
story books, flags and pictures, and we are glad to report that our
86 chapters are every one doing some of this work.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 259
We are proud of our education work and prouder still of our
Chairman, Mrs. L. M. Bashinsky, an indefatigable worker. She re-
ports more than 113 full scholarships valued at twelve thousand
dollars and an endowment fund of eighteen thousand dollars. The
Electra Semmes Colston scholarship, named in honor of Admiral
Semmes' daughter, was completed at the last Convention, and a
new one, the Elizabeth Dowdell, was begun.
Mrs. Bashinsky is publishing another cook book similar to her
first one, which was so successful, $5,500.00 having been realized
from the sale for the Scholarship Endowment fund, the proceeds
of which will be given for education, also.
Registration
Much progress has been made this past year in the complete reg-
istration of the individual members of the Chapters. In the past,
owing to laxness in our methods of recording, many ghapters were
not completely registered. Much praise is due our Mrs. Halsey,
the present Division Registrar and our vRegistrar-General, for the
thoroughness of their work. Too much Emphasis cannot be placed
on the importance and necessity of having correct and complete
records t
Finance
Our Treasurer reported to me, just before leaving for this Con-
vention, that all pledges and bills had been paid leaving a small
balance in our treasury for emergencies.
Memorials
Our Division at its Convention in May, having endorsed the
completion of the Stone Mountain Memorial, pledged to assist in
selling the half-dollars which were issued by the United States
Government. The first official act of the in-coming President was
to send out a letter to each chapter asking their co-operation in
helping our State Director, Mr. Wells, to sell these coins.
An oil portrait of the gallant Pelham was placed in Alabama's
room in the Confederate Museum at Richmond, Virginia. This was
the thought arid work of our retiring President, Mrs. C. S. McDow7-
efl, and was finished and paid for during this last year. The win-
dow memorializing our Cadet Soldiers of 61-65, has been complet-
ed after 13 years of effort and at a cost of more than $3,000, and
placed in the new Gorgas Memorial at the University Library, Tus-
caloosa. It was unveiled with beautiful ceremonies during the
Confederate Reunion in October. It is a Tiffany Window and rep-
resents the "Christian Crusader." The unveiling was planned and
carried out by Mrs. Chappell Cory, acting vice-chairman of the
Committee. Our pledge for the Woodrow Wilson scholarship has
been paid. Funds for a State monument at Gettysburg are stead-
ily growing, and plans for marking the Jefferson Davis Highway
in Alabama are being promoted. Alabama Division promises to
finish in this next year a suitable and attractive memorial on the
site of the Arsenal in Selma, Alabama, around which centers so
much history. Here it was that the cannons were manufactured
and but a short distance above Selma the bullets were made by the
father of cur great General Gorgas.

260 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Gathering from the report of Mrs. Embry, Division Director of
the book, "Women of the South in War Times," Alabama has not
disposed of her quota, but she will with a little more time given.
Mrs. J. V. Staley, Director of the Norman V. Randolph Relief
Fund, gives a royal report, having "gone over the top." She col-
lected during the past year $375. From the report of our World
War Record's Director, Mrs. J. E. Aberhold, we find that a number
of "Crosses of Service" have been bestowed by the Chapters.
This report must not be closed without reference to our Public-
ity methods. Two of our largest newspapers, The Birmingham
News and the Montgomery Advertiser, continue to give their col-
umns free to us, by which our chapters are kept in touch with the
work and with each other and many interesting and true stories
are printed for our use. We are pleased to report too, that some
of the chapters and many individuals subscribe to the "Confeder-
ate Veteran" and find it most interesting and useful in making up
their programs. Again I thank you for your forbearance and re-
new my pledge to give my best to our great cause.
Respectfully submitted,
MRS. T. W. (LULU RAINER) PALMER.
President Alabama Division U. D. C.
ARIZONA DIVISION
Madam President-General and Daughters in Convention Assembled:
It is again my pleasant privilege to extend to you greetings
from the far away baby Division, Arizona. We feel our isolation,
but are trying to do a few things well of the many we would like
to do. We recently held our Division Convention in Phoenix with
Robert E. Lee Chapter as hostess. Our two Chapters found, as the
reports were read, that much had been accomplished for the cause
we hold' dear.
Our Division offered the United Daughters of the Confederacy
medal for the best essay written by a senior in our State Teachers'
College at Tempe, on the subject, "Jamestown: First English Set-
tlement in America." Medal was won by Miss Margaret Hamilton.
Through the efficient and untiring efforts of our Jefferson Davis
Highway Director, Mrs. W. T. Crawford, the Highway is located
and well marked across the State.
We pledge five dollars to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Schol-
arship and each Chapter has observed all Memorial Days.
Robert E. Lee Chapter, of Phoenix, succeeded in placing one of
our Veterans in the Pioneer's Home, at Prescott, and materially
assisted another living in Tucson. They gave a successful card
party to increase their benevolent fund and, on the 3rd of June,
last, remembered the birth of Jefferson Davis with a typical
Southern dinner, served in the beautiful garden of Mrs. B. M. At-
wood, with Dixie Chapter as their guests. The lovely garden, the
clear sky, with its star brilliants, and the congenial hostess and

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 261
guests, made it an occasion long to be remembered. There were
many interesting talks including a brief recounting of the life of
President Davis, by the Division President.
Dixie Chapter remembered the dear old ladies of the 60's in a
gift of five dollars to the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Fund, and have
aided other charities. They have marked the graves of Veterans
in our local cemetery and have markers prepared for others whose
resting place has recently been located. The minister of the
Christian Church, of Tempe, extended an invitation to the Daugh-
ters to attend Memorial Day service. They accepted and were ac-
corded equal recognition with the American Legion as a patriot-
ic organization.
Our two Chapters met in a joint picnic at a familiar spot on the
desert, the occasion being the birthday of Dixie. The luncheon
was served under an over hanging rock, surrounded with such
beauty as ony an Arizona desert can produce. Cactus and mes-
quite with mountains in the distance and over all an azure sky,
formed an impressive setting.
Our Division is stressing historical work this year and a com-
mittee is compiling a little book, "The Sunny Side of It," which
will record huinprous incidents of the War Between the States.
A member of our Division submitted a'criticism of an United States
History in competition for the F. E. Davis Prize.
Another work launched by us is a memorial to the late Senator
Marcus T. Smith, who represented Arizona at the National Cap-
ital for forty years, first as Territorial Delegate, then United Sta4
Senator. Our vast irrigation and other projects, which have con-
tributed to the advancement of our State, are due to his broad vi-
sion. This loyalty to our interests will cause him to live forever
in the hearts of our people. It will probably be of special interest
to our Kentucky Daughters to learn that Senator Smith was a na-
tive of their commonwealth.
We hope to establish at least one new Chapter this year and have
an organizer in the field to further this plan.
Both Chapters remembered the Veterans at Christmas and fre-
quently entertained them as guests at their meetings.
I have enjoyed my two years' work as President of Arizona Di-
vision and bespeak for my successor, Mrs. Sam H. Kyle, of Phoe-
nix, all the courtesies and encouragement I have received from the
General Organization.
Respectfully submitted,
ADELINE D. QUINN,
President Arizona Division.

ARKANSAS DIVISION
Madam President-General and Daughters of the Confederacy:
Greetings and best wishes for a successful Convention!
Arkansas is honored to have you assembled within her borders,
and her more than 2,500 Daughters are united in the hope that
much that is good may result from your visit with us.
As the leader of the Arkansas Division, I have many fine things
to report, made possible by the loyal cooperation of the member-
ship.
Our State Convention held in Conway, October 27, 28 and 29,
With Robert E. Lee Chapter as hostess, was the most interesting
in our history, from the standpoint of work accomplished, enthu-
siasm and enlarged vision.
We have had a great awakening in the work of the Children of
the Confederacy. Several new Chapters have been organized, with
a total membership of more than three hundred. The Margaret
Rose Chapter of Little Rock, having a membership of one hundred
sixty-five members, is our largest Chapter. Think what this will
mean in just a few years when these boys and girls, trained in
Southern history and ideals, stand ready to take their places in the
ranks of the Sons of Veterans, and the Daughters of the Confed-
eracy.
Memorial
All Memorial Days have been observed throughout our Division
with appropriate and impressive ceremonies. Three hundred and
fourteen markers have been placed upon the graves of Confeder-
ate Veterans.
Monuments
October saw the completion and unveiling of a Confederate
monument in Conway, by the members of the Robert E. Lee Chap-
ter, who prepared a beautiful program for the occasion. Our
"Confederate Mothers' Park at Russellville, has been well kept,
and several substantial improvements made. At Prairie Grove the
historic old battlefield has been converted into a beautiful park;
this was bought by the Prairie Grove Chapter and presented to
the Arkansas Division. 1925 was a great year for it, for the im-
posing entrance begun in 1924 was completed, a beautiful band-
stand of white Pojtland cement erected, and artistic driveways
made. Each year, through the courtesy of the Prairie Grove Chap-
ter, a reunion of old soldiers is held in this park. On the second
day of their reunion this year, an impressive dedication service
was held. From distant States came many old veterans to this
meeting, who took part in the battle of Prairie Grove. At the close
of the service, an elaborate meal was served by the members of the
local Chapter, and this historic spot which sixty years ago re-
sounded with the scream of shot and shell, presented a peaceful,
\

happy scene, with Veterans who wore the Blue and those who
wore the Gray seated side by side—good Americans all.
DISBURSEMENTS
Arkansas has paid all her obligations. Our total expenditures for
State and National work in all departments amount to $9,417.93.
Our pledge of $50.00 fo Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund was
raised to $100.00. At the Convention held in Savannah, Arkansas
pledged $100.00 to the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship Fund, and
Mrs. J. T. Beal pledged $100.00, Mrs. Frank Tillar $50.00 and Mrs.
J. F W. Weinmann $50.00, making $300.00. Mrs. T. J. Newman,
Director for Arkansas, secured $261.00 from Chapters for Arkansas,
bringing the total up to $561.00.
History i
We are proud of the work done in our department of history.
Our State Historian has collected nearly three thousand pages of
history, placed twenty-five books in libraries and sixty-two in
schools; has reviewed many historical books, made several ad
dresses to schools, and, as a climax to a year of hard work, on
Historical Evening at our Division Convention, put on a beautiful
original pageant, depicting life and customs of the Old South.
Essays
Closely connected with, and really a part of this department,
is our essay work. This year there were more than seventeen
prizes awarded at the Convention, and twelve hundred essays en-
tered in the contest. All over the State when the subjects were
given to the schools, talks were made by members of the local
Chapters. On each occasion when a prize was presented, address-
es were made by Daughters. Besides these Division prizes, local
prizes were given in various parts of the State. Our chairman of
Reciprocity has collected many historical documents and papers
for use in Chapters.
Portraits
Eighteen portraits of Confederate Generals have been placed in
Arkansas schools through the work of our faithful chairman and
her splendid committee. We are putting forth special effort to
have the Confederate Veteran placed in all our schools, libraries
and homes. .
Books
We have sent eighteen to foreign libraries and placed many vol-
umes in school libraries. We are glad to announce that Arkansas
this year bought and paid for her full quota of "Women of the
South in War Times."
Through the faithful work of our chairman, our women are be-
coming better acquainted with the Rutherford publications, and
many of our Chapters are using them as reference works in the
preparation of year books. Our chairman of text books has been
watchful of histories and literature used in our public schools. We

are glad to report that our history, "Arkansas' part in War and Re-
construction," written by Dr. D. Y. Thomas, has been finished and
is now in the hands of the publisher.
As President of the Arkansas Division, I wish to express my
thanks to Miss Mildred Rutherford of Athens, Georgia, and Hon-
orable Robert L. Preston of Leesburg, Virginia, for valuable in-
formation furnished in the compiling of this work.
Confederate Home
Daughters of the Arkansas Division take great pride in our Cory-
federate Home—one of the best in the South. Each year a Christ-
mas tree is given by the Division to the two hundred inmates, and
a Christmas program arranged by the three Chapters in our Cap-
ital city. We have a committee for relief and entertainment of
Veterans and their wives, and throughout the year, these good
women are busy planning and working to make brighter the lives
of these so dear to us. At the January meeting of our executive
board, an invitation was extended by Mr. McDaniel, the efficient
superintendent of the Home, to members to have luncheon with
these dear old people. It was a day long to be remembered. How
happy were they to have us, and what joy was ours to be with
them, and see how tenderly they are cared for in their declining
years. Each Chapter has adopted a number of these Veterans and
on their birthdays send post cards and remembrances.
Education
This has been a banner year for us in education. All our schol-
arships in our different State colleges were taken by bright young
people as were those maintained by Chapters. Our Students Loan
Fund has gone further than any preceding year. We have added
two thousand and five dollars this year, bringing our total up to
$5,747.00—this being $747.00 more than the goal for which we
started. A goodly part of this sum was' raised through the gener-
osity of Mrs. John F. Weinmann, Mrs. J. T. Beal and Mrs. F. V.
Holmes. Through the courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Abner Gaines, the
Reynolds Monument Fund was transferred to the department of
education. Through Mrs. Nellie Trevanthan of Batesville, a schol-
arship in a business college has been added to the list. Memorial
Chapter at Little Rock is raising $500.00 for a Chapter Loan Fund.
Eight Crosses of Service have been given.
I visited twenty-one towns in the interest of the United Daugh-
ters of the Confederacy, and have assisted in the organization of
two fine Chapters. I attended the reunion at Dallas, Texas. I have
Written nearly three thousand letters. Chapters are kept in close
touch with each othter through the columns of two of our largest
newspapers, to which letters are sent each month. Our greatest
triumph, however, is the fact that we were able to induce you to
bring this fine Convention to Arkansas, and our greatest privilege
is the joy of sharing with the hospitable city of Hot Springs in en-
tertaining you. Your presence and your fine messages will be an
inspiration to greater service in the future.
Respectfully submitted,
LORA GAINES GOOLSBY.
President Arkansas Division..

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 265
CALIFORNIA DIVISION
Madam President-General and Daughters of the Confederacy:
Valiant Victors deserve the admiration of the vanquished, so Cal-
ifornia brings greetings, and congratulates Arkansas on her ob-
viously superior qualifications as hostess, already numerously ev-
idenced in countless courtesies and illimitable hospitality.
Since we were not permitted to entertain you collectively we
delighted in bestowing, during her short visit, our concentrated at-
tentions on that peerless leader, our President-General, Mrs. Har-
rold, who with rare charm gave us richly of her guiding knowl-
edge, and gracious helpfulness, and met in social contact fully a
thousand, about three-fourths of our members.
Though far removed geographically, California's devotion to the
objects of this organization is well known, our members deeply
imbued with the proper spirit free from all selfish desire or self-
seeking. The many reports you have heard, enumerated our spe-
cific part, and no duplicating items shall be tabulated here. Our
historic work has been hindered during this administration by
three changes of directors because of illness.
California chapters have this year contributed sums averaging
almost five dollars per member, aside from per capita tax. The
greater portion is alloted always to our Relief Fund, for as re-
ported before, we receive absolutely no State or other aid in
caring for our aged Southern Women and Confederate Veterans,—
those Masters of Fate who wearily but courageously journeyed
westward to rehabilitate in new environs; and, while prosperity
blessed most of them, some were unable successfully to meet life's
battles and provide for future sustenance. Care and aid for these,
is now our sacred duty, which every chapter fulfills most ardent-
ly, paying for burial of all who die without funds.
A memorable event recently occurred in Oakland, when S. A.
Cunningham Chapter United Daughters of Confederacy, was, with
pleasing ceremonies by Appomattox Post G. A. R., presented with
a huge Confederate flag purloined near Richmond, Virginia, during
seige of that city. This flag is a priceless treasure given in splen-
did spirit.
Through the generous courtesy of "The Veteran," you saw pic-
ture and an account of that momentous occasion last June, when
the first Confederate monument in the West was unveiled in Hol-
lywood cemetery, where it stands, rugged and firm, a granite
boulder with bronze plaque, eloquent and typical of the charac-
ters it commemorates. This was not wholly a United Daughter of
Confederacy endeavor so the President personally paid for the
picture and description in the Division year book.
The Sons of Confederate Veterans are at present organizing in
San Francisco, under Robert E. Lee Mook, his wife a United
Daughters of the Confederacy member.
Nothing it would seem, has ever brought to the United Daugh-
ters of the Confederacy so much favorable notice and newspaper

commendation in California as the appointment of its President to
represent the General Organization United Daughters of the Con-
federacy in the Americanism Section at the American Legion's re-
cent general Convention in Omaha, where the report of our con-
structive patriotic work was eagerly received, apparently creat-
ing a profound impression, and California thanks the President-
General for honor of this appointment.
With perhaps as many more now in process of formation, three
new California Chapters are chartered and duly credited in this
Convention—Twin Peaks in San Francisco, Mary Curtis Lee in Los
Angeles, and Wm. Gibbs McAdoo in Hollywood, the last having a
delegate here, Mrs. J. Edward Haley, first Vice-President. After
functioning at only one regular meeting, this baby Chapter gave 19
members, on November 6, a dinner and ball, "A Night in Dixie,"
that netted nearly a thousand dollars, thus establishing its relief
and educational funds. All other chapters are likewise energetic
and enthusiastic; Albert Sidney Johnston recently made about half
the above amount at its annual ball.
Los Angeles Chapter has to report through its delegate, Mrs. Al-
bert L. Bagnall, a contribution from Mr. Bagnall of .$1000.00 to the
Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship.
California's length reaches as far as from Maine to Florida, yet
its President last year met with every chapter once, some many
times. Thus far this year twenty have been visited at regular
meetings, the other five soon to be called on; many splendid social
affairs were also attended. California's President defrays all ex-
penses in connection with her work, and office, from postage to
attending General Convention.
The co-operation of chapters and members, individually and col-
lectively, and the support accorded in every wish and idea, have
been deeply, yes touchingly gratifying; and while California seems
greatly to have increased in membership, activity and interest, its
President delegates unto herself no special credit, for psycholog-
ically it seems the cycle of inspiration has swung around and she
is merely the medium through which it finds expression. She re-
grets that this appearance concludes her participation as a Di-
vision President in your councils, but reserves the privilege occa-
sionally to come—and always to serve, and to live in recollections
of her work and contributions of energy, time and funds, all done
in sacred memory and as a tribute to a Confederate Veteran fath-
er, (who fought in the Battle of Pea Ridge near here and many oth-
ers.) and an heroic mother, eoually and willinglv sacrificing every-
thing for the principles and traditions of the Old South.
Faithfully submitted,
MARGARET PREWETT (MRS. CHESTER A.) GARFIELD.
President, California Division.

was received with enthusiasm, the information creating a profound
impression. This circular is issued to summarize United Daugh-
ters of the Confederacy work and Patriotism, and to assist in in-
creasing membership; it may be used for publicity; its cost is paid
by its author.)
October 2nd, 1925.
The American Legion in Convention Assembled
(Americanism Section):
Greatly do we appreciate the courtesy conveyed when you bade
us participate in your conferences, especially the Americanism Sec-
tion, and California is signally honored when its President is des-
ignated as spokesman, for to the far western shores of our mag-
nificent United States has been carried the true spirit of America,
not only by earlier settlers with the average number of Southern-
ers, but later by those Masters of Fate, many ex-Confederates who
sought to rehabilitate, and after endless heartaches and hardships
over long weary trails, transplanted and cherished and nourished
our old traditions and left us a priceless heritage of American Pa-
triotism in American homes. From these and the homes of the
Old South there poured forth countless tens of thousands who
joined the World War hosts, and those not taken as toll of war
now belong to your American Legion!
It was that most striking example of the real American, ex-Gov-
ernor Lowden, of Illinois, as speaker of the evening and special
honor guest at our General Convention, in Savannah, November,
1924, who said in part that "we learned during mobilization for
the World War that the purest American blood, as we choose to
call ourselves Americans, was found in the South and that in fu-
ture—unless we change conditions—to the South we shall have to
continue to look for our truest Americanism."
The United Daughters of the Confederacy was formed thirty
years ago to give aid and care to the umoensioned (properly so),
crippled and devastated remnants of the Confederate Army, whose
viewpoint has long since manv times been vindicated, the last in-
stance being When President Coolidge and his Congress authorized
minting of Stone Mountain Memorial Coin, dedicated "to the Valor
of the Soldier of the South" inscription on one side and the heads
of Lee and Jackson on the other; the sale giving two and a half
million dollars to complete Stone Mountain Monument.
The United Daughters of the Confederacy has NEVER been a se-
cret organization, anyone may attend its meetings. With its hun-
dred thousand members it contributed heavily to every avenue of
War work, and maintained seventy-two beds in the American Me-
morial Hospital at Neuilly. France, pledging to do so as long as re-
quired. The emergency finally over, it recently has installed as a
permanent memorial in this Hospital, a modern American electric
elevator, dedicated to those American Men of Confederate Ances-
try who died overseas.
Our United Daughters of the Confederacy formed 229 Red Cross
chapters; contributed as United Daughters of the Confederal
Chapters and Divisions $448,000 in money to the Red Cross, and
to other war agencies .$393,000: and bought officiallv as Daughters
of the Confederacv $24,850,000 worth of Liberty Bonds and War
Savings Stamps. These figures do not include individual contri-

buttons through other channels, but are our actual official records,
which also show we made 6,000,000 hospital garments, 14,000,000
surgical dressings and 600,000 knitted garments; also officially
adopted and cared for 2200 Belgian and French orphans at a cost
of $82,000.
Last year, aside from vast sums expended for Relief of Veterans
and Aged Southern Women, we used $304,000.00 for our scholar-
ships in colleges and universities, and initiated a $50,000 Woodrow
Wilson Memorial Scholarship for the study of International Law
looking toward World Peace. We have erected many monuments
to our Southern Heroes, for if we do not honor our ancestors we
cannot hope to merit the reverence of our posterity.
When our records are complete we expect to show that in the
American Expeditionary Forces the greatest per capita percentage
came from the South. For our "Cross of Service," bestowted only
on lineal descendants of Confederate soldiers, requests for twenty
thousand are filed this first year.
As an example of Service and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy Americanism, will you pardon mention of four years of ab-
solute volunteer time, by the speaker as Red Cross Director for
Pacific Coast of Foreign Correspondence and Prisoners' Relief,—
the special activity being to restore lost lines of communication be-
tween overseas men and mothers or families here? This also in-
cluded finding many men in enemy prisons. Most interesting and
vital contacts were made, but sometimes our overseas searcher sent
—not a message nor letter from the "lost boy," but a faded flower
from Flanders Field that was touchingly eloquent.
Trusting you will give us futher opportunity to cooperate with
you, and assuring you of our desire always to SERVE, in the name
of our President-General, Mrs. Frank Harrold, of Georgia, and the
United Daughters of the Confederacy, I remain
Faithfully yours,
MARGARET PREWETT GARFIELD,
President, California Division.
COLORADO DIVISION
Madam President-General and Daughters of the Confederacy in
Convention Assembled:
Colorado Division sends greetings and best wishes for a success-
ful Convention.
It is with pleasure that this report is summitted to you. Small
in numbers is the Colorado Division, but each Chapter is loyally
endeavoring to increase its membership, and with the annually in-
creasing numbers of Southerners coming to our beloved Colorado,
our prospects are very bright indeed.
We were signally honored this year by a visit from a President-
General, the first time in the history of the Colorado Division and
our own gracious and charming Mrs. Harrold quite won the hearts


## p. 269 (#273) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 269
of those fortunate enough to meet her and the uplifting talk which
she gave will long be an inspiration to us all.
We have quite a few Veterans in the State whom we are privil-
eged to aid—four in the Soldiers and Sailors Home to whom we
send spending money each month. For one old gentleman we
have paid the taxes and water rent for several years, a daughter
of a Veteran has had her rent paid for a long time. Christmas
time we make an extra effort to get in touch with every Veteran
and send them besides good things to eat, clothing, fuel, etc.
Educationally we are handicapped for naturally public sentiment
is against our trying to get facts of Southern history in the public
schools and the press is not very generous in allowing us very
much space, either, which makes it all the more imperative that
parents encourage their children to belong to a Children's Chapter.
We welcomed a new Chapter into our Division this year, the
Stonewall Jackson Chapter of Denver, and I am hoping to add three
more Chapters before spring.
We were called upon to mourn the death of a most loyal and
efficient worker, Mrs. Juan Rayner, Honorary and Past Division
President.
I could not close this without a word about Fitzsimmons Hos-
pital, the largest hospital in the world for ex-service men. It is
my pleasure and privilege to visit this hospital weekly, and how
many things there are to be done for these boys for whom the war
is not over and who are still "carrying on." I am sure it will
amaze you to know that half of the 1800 men in this hospital are
Southern boys.
One Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy has an
entire ward of fifty beds which they visit regularly and seek in
every way to aid and cheer the many homesick boys who are pa-
tients there.
With the deepest appreciation for the consideration shown us
by the officers of the General organization and with the assurance
of the loyalty and cooperation of the Colorado Division, I beg you
to accept this report.
Respectfully submitted,
(MRS. B. L.) FLORA T. DOUGLAS,
President Colorado Division.
FLORIDA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confedera-
cy:
I bring you sincere greetings and love from Florida.
This is my second and last report to you as President of my Di-
vision and it is with much regret that I am soon to lose the affil-
iation with the General Officers with whom I have been associat-
ed for the past two years.


## p. 270 (#274) ############################################

270 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
You have been so patient, so willing and so prompt on any mat-
ter which I brought before you.
Florida has organized three new Chapters since last Convention,
Alexander Stephens, Ft. Pierce and Woodrow Wilson, (the baby
Chapter), with a paid up membership of 2,229, and have recorded
5,350. Three children's Chapters have been completed, with the
promise of two more. A membership of 661 is recorded—73 new
members, since last Convention.
Thirty-eight Chapters are in good standing. Two Chapters—
Francis C. Wilson and Stars and Bars—are reported delinquent be-
cause of failure to pay 1925 dues. Some of the Chapters of my Di-
vision do not seem to understand why Florida has not received any
Certificates since our Division Convention last May. This I am
asking the Registrar-General to please explain to them by letter.
Through the efforts of Major-General McKay, the late Command-
er of the Florida Division United Confederate Veterans, Florida
Veterans got an increase of pension through the legislature of
$15.00 per month, making a total for each of $40.00, which I believe
is more than any Southern State pays.
All Division pledges made at the Savannah Convention have been
met, and some of them over-paid.
We are stressing our Educational work greatly, and are now
supporting three Division scholarships, 15 Chapter scholarships
and giving 12 prizes with this part of our work, making through
our efforts about $3,000.00 given to help the boys and girls of our
Country to become better citizens.
We are proud to, of our General scholarships—one at. the Uni-
versity of Virginia and the other at the Baptist Theological Semi-
nary, Louisville, Ky.
The Historical year book sent out by the Historian shows mark-
ed interest in the program at each Chapter meeting.
The "Confederate Veteran" subscriptions are forty-six new sub-
scriptions, and forty-two renewals. Owing to a misunderstanding
the Director has sent most of these subscriptions direct to the
"Veteran"' instead of to the Division Treasurer and Treasurer-Gen-
eral.
The Director has done splendid work and from now on the sub-
scriptions will be handled through the proper ones.
Fifty World War Crosses of Service have been recorded by the
Director, with increased interest shown by Chapters ordering
blanks.
The Jefferson Davis Highway does not touch Florida, but we are
deeply interested in the great Highway and as given in the Treas-
urer-General's report, Florida, through the efforts of the Direct-
or, comes second in amounts given.
The "Women of the South in War Times'' is the only part of our
work in which we have fallen short. This has not been any fault
of the Director, but some of the Chapters in failing to buy their
allotment.


## p. 271 (#275) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 271
The legislature of our State has been most kind to the Daugh-
ters, having appropriated at their last session for our causes nice
amounts for the Confederate Museums, Chair of Southern History
at the Women's College, Tallahassee, Gamble Mansion (Home of
Judah P. Benjamin) purchased by the Chapter at Bradenton, and
the Olustee Monument for a keeper and upkeep of monument and
grounds. In short time the Chairman, Mrs. J. C. Miller, will have
a neat Keeper's Lodge built. This monument marks one of the
historic spots of our struggle, and it situated about sixty miles
northwest of Jacksonville.
Funds have been raised to erect a bronze marker (Lee on Trav-
eler) at the entrance of the Dixie Highway into Florida and this
will soon be placed by a Committee.
For itemized statement of Florida's donations to the different
causes, see reports of Treasurer-General, General Directors and
Chairmen.
I thank each General Officer for all you have done for us, and
I wish for the incoming officers success in all your plans for the
coming year.
Sincerely,
(MRS. J. C.) NINA HILL BLOCKER,
President Florida Division U. D. C.
FRANCE—MAJOR-GENERAL DE POLIGNAC CHAPTER
Madam President-General and Daughters of the Confederacy:
This year will mark in the annals of our Chapter, for in it we
have achieved the task we set before us in 1921: The erection of
the Polignac-Mouton Monument on the battlefield of Mansfield!
The shaft is of grey granite from Georgia's Stone Mountain and
the monument was constructed by Arthur Weiblen of New Orleans
from a design sent by the Polignac Chapter in Paris.
Its cost was $2300, of which $1805 have been raised and $495
are still needed.
All thanks are due to Miss M. Poppenheim and the ladies of the
Louisiana committee for the erection of the monument. Mrs. Fred
Kolman, Mrs. Peter Youree, Mrs. C. H. Granger. Mrs. A. Weber,
Miss Doriska Gautreaux and Mrs. S. A. Pegues. It is to their un-
tiring and persevering efforts that we owe the success of our en-
terprise.
Through the care of the Kate Beard Chapter in Mansfield the
Monument was erecte4 close to the spot where General Alfred Mou-
ton fell, in a beautiful park of which the ground has been donated
by Mrs. Porter, Mrs. Youree and the Shreveport Chapter.
The unveiling took place on the 8th of April during the Conven-
tion of the Louisiana Division.

272 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Our Vice-President Princess Camille de Polignac, widow of Ma-
jor-General de Polignac had the joy and honor of being present
at the inauguration. With her son Prince Victor Mansfield, named
after the battle in Louisiana, she left for America solely for this
purpose.
This is the account she write me of these memorable days:
"My dear daughter: I cannot, in a few lines, give you an ac-
count of the wonderful days I spent in America, but I will try to
describe to you the joyful emotions I experienced in the South,
in dear Dixieland, where to me chivalry and sunshine are at home
and have always been blended together in my mind since early
childhood.
For, when General de Polignac returned from America, one of
the first visits he paid was to my family, and from his lips they
heard, as I did often later, accounts of the fighting days he had
just been through. He was still then suffering from swamp fev-
er from which he was troubled still many years. The tributes of
friendship he had received during his campaign in the South were
innumerable and always present to his mind and many a time did
he tell me of them.
Now it is from personal experience that I can speak of that
dear Country where I met with naught but kindness.
My first interesting experience was in Washington. At lunch at
the British Embassy I met Chief Justice Taft, the most popular
man in America, as a French gentleman, my neighbour at table,
told me. I had an interesting talk with Mr. Taft about my object
in coming to America and I found him sympathetic to the United
Daughters of Confederacy.
At Richmond the Daughters were very amicable and showed us
over the fine building of the Confederate Museum. We went all
through the rooms seeing much of interest and relics of heroic
days. We were especially interested to see where General de Po-
lignac's sword of Honor hung in the Louisiana room and gave a
large photo of my dear husband to be placed with it.
Charleston received us next with bright sunshine and flowers
and though our train arrived very early we found our dear and
most kind hostesses, the Misses Poppenheim, waiting for us. It
would take too long to tell all we did in this beautiful city, and the
innumerable kindnesses that were shown us by all. Here my son
and I had the happiest of times, here Victor made his maiden
speech at the splendid reception given us by the United Daughters
of the Confederacy in their famous hall. Here too, we were en-
tertained by Colonial Dames in the old Powder Magazine and by
the Daughters of the Revolution in their so interesting "Old Ex-
change" Chapter house.
After a delightful journey in the comfortable American trains,
we arrived in Atlanta and were motored out to see Stone Mountain
with its wonderful bas relief of General Lee and his officers, which
in time will be the greatest Memorial in the world. The receDtion
given us there bv the Daushters was most charming and we heard
beautiful addresses which touched me to tears. Here I had the


## p. 273 (#277) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 273
pleasure of seeing our President-General, Mrs. F. Harrold, whom I
had met two years ago in Neuilly.
Arriving late at night at Shreveport we found that the United
Daughters of the Confederacy had provided us with most comfort-
able rooms. The next morning, April the 7, in beautiful weather,
Mr. Ned Jenkins fetched us in motors and we drove through very
pretty country to Mr. and Mrs. Ned Jenkins' lovely home, where
we were very cordially and sweetly entertained.
The Convention in Mansfield was in full swing and we went
there to hear the speeches and recitations all of great interest to
us. These new surroundings so different from anything we had
seen before, the enthusiasm of every one there for this dear lost
cause, were a revelation to me. Here we were about 9000 miles
from our home country suddenly put down in the heart of a coun-
try's emotions, enthusiasms and affections. It was a thrilling ex-
perience and the morrow was to crown and fix all these emotions.
The evening we spent at a banquet charmingly managed at the
young ladies college. They sang for us and gave us a rousing rebel
yell.
The 8th of April dawned fine and mild. Our energetic and ac-
tive young host and his charming young wife from Texas, motored
us into Mansfield with our French and American flags flying. The
Convention was in session, the band playing in front of the court
house grounds and long tables were set out for the Veterans, Mrs.
Dick Taylor Stauffer's and our parties. Many Veterans came up to
speak to us and at some moments the crowd was tremendous, but
so absorbing was it all that I did not notice the passing of time,
when we were taken up to the court house for a rest. Seated
in window seats overlooking the gardens, Miss Poppenheim and I
spoke with some of the Veterans of the great past, which seemed
to live again that day in their hearts. One of them from Texas
came on crutches, a fine man, brought to Mansfield by his son and
grandson. He had served in my husband's Texas Brigade.
At about three-thirty, a procession being formed with the band
we were motored out to Mansfield Memorial Park, going through
a large crowd to get to the stand. From the platform we could
see the two shafts in their white linen shrouds, behind them the
ground rose gently towards the blue sky and was covered by the
crowd who had taken advantage of the rise to look upon the cer-
emony.
The proceedings were opened by the recitation of the Lord's
Prayer, in which the whole crowd joined us, which was most im-
pressive.
One felt one was "in God's country," as a ladv wrote; me. For
in America men as well as women are not shy of loving and ador-
ing God!
We then took seats and Mrs. Pegues most ably presided over all
the events. I was very much touched to receive a large bunch of
the lilies of France.
After beautiful speeches by Mrs. Tompkins, the silver tongued
speaker. Miss Poppenheim and Mr. Elman, Victor was called upon
to unveil his Father's monument. To me a tense moment when I

was to see for the first time this shaft of grey granite, which would
outlive us all.
On a sign of Mrs. Pegues my son pulled the strings; the linen
fell and Victor's voice came to me across the intervening space.
He ended with words from R. E. Lee: "Let us mourn the loss of
our gallant dead in every conflict, yet our gratitude to Almighty
God for his mercies rise higher and higher each day, to Him and
to the valour of our troops, a nation's gratitude is due." And the
rebel yell from the veterans came with more vim when they heard
the name of their great commander.
We turned then to see Mrs. Taylor Stauffer's son unveil the mon-
ument to her glorious Father, General Dick Taylor's memory, who
with sword and pen served the Confederate cause so nobly.
It was with great emotion that, accompanied by Miss Poppen-
heim, I walked on the ground where 61 years before my dear hus-
band had passed. We placed flowers at the foot of each monu-
ment.
Many kindly greetings were again offered me from the crowd
as on the arm of Mr. Jenkins we regained the automobiles. That
evening under the colonnades of his lovely home we listened to
the negroes singing. In the bright moonshine these kind coloured
people sang us the old plantation songs in minor keys.
Thus ended this most perfect and successful day, for which we
had to thank our Hostess Chapter, Kate Beard, its President and
the so hospitable and courteous citizens of Mansfield.
We could not leave Louisiana without visiting New Orleans!
There, too, we experienced the renowned hospitality of the South.
The last vision we had of America was in New York on the boat
when Mrs. Rowe Schuyler, in the name of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy there, presented us with a magnificent trophy of
glorious flowers.
This beautiful florsl gift remained fragrant to our journey's end,
reminding me of all my cherished memories of the South, memo-
ries inscribed in golden letters in my heart, which will not fade,
but be passed on to my children as a sweet inheritance!

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 275
GEORGIA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
Georgia Division is happy to report a year full of interest, en-
thusiasm ..and progress along all lines of United Daughters of the
Confederacy activity.
Georgia's 31st Annual Convention
This Convention was held at Sandersville, October 27th to 29th,
and reports of Officers, Chairmen of Committees, Directors, and
Chapter President gave evidence of splendid progress during the
year. We were honored by having with us our President-General,
Mrs. Harrold, whose presence at Conventions and Executive Board
meetings during my two years term of office, just now closing,
has been most inspiring. "Text Books" was our key-note.
Registration
Georgia Division has 123 Chapters only two of which are inac-
tive now and these two have signified, a wish to re-organize. There
are no new Chapters since last year but three are just ready to
organize and others are working to that end. I am happy to an-
nounce that during the year several Chapters that have been inac-
tive or dormant for some years past have re-organized, and this
is even more important, we find, than the organizing of new Chap-
ters.
Georgia is most fortunate in her Registrar who has labored with
ability, accuracy and fidelity at all times. There are 632 new
members for this year, "with 629 last year, making a total of 1261
new members during the two years I have served as President, and
this gives Georgia a grand total of 17,452 members. We have lost
by death 66.
Georgia is striving for complete registration and this has been
almost accomplished. Our Registrar's slogan for the coming year
is "Registration from every active Chapter in Division, revival of
old ones; organization of new ones; a membership drive in every
Chapter to secure new members, especially for those between ages
of 17 and 25 years."
Children of the Confederacy
The Division Director Children of Confederacy reports 367 new
members and nine new Chapters. Miss Adeline Baum, Division
Organizer, has accomplished splendid results and her interest and
work is untiring. The Georgia Children of Confederacy has its
own Conference each year, has a splendid list of scholarships and
publishes its own minutes.
Finances
Georgia's Division is proud of her efficient and prompt Treas-
urer, Mrs. Chas. Tillman. $8293.11 has passed through her hands


## p. 276 (#280) ############################################

276 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
and $1514.15 has been paid to Treasurer-General for dues. This
amount is somewhat smaller than it would have been had not the
Treasurer-General expressly requested that only members paying
their own dues be listed. It has formerly been the pleasure and
privilege of a number of Chapters in Georgia to pay dues for some
wives of Confederate Veterans. One Chapter alone formerly paid
dues for fifty such members. In addition to the amount coming
into the Division Treasurer's hands, each Chapter has done won-
derful local work, such as relief for needy Veterans, Historical,
Markers and Monuments, Scholarships and Prizes in schools and
Colleges and other civic work. A number of Chapters now have
on deposit their full $1,000.00 for Stone Mountain Memorial and
only wait for the present management of the Association to adjust
its difficulties before paying it over.
Crosses of Honor
Our Recorder of Crosses of Honor reports that 77 have been giv-
en this year to Confederate Veterans. The O. C. Home Chapter of
Hawkinsville gave 30 of these. Most of our Veterans have already
received crosses.
Crosses of Service
Georgia Division has given 180 Crosses of Service to World War
Veterans. The largest number by any one Chapter 51, was given
by O. C. Home Chapter of Hawkinsville.
Confederate Veteran
We cannot report the fine number of subscriptions to the Vet-
eran that we would wish. However, many subscriptions are made
which do not pass through the hands of our Division Chairman.
One or two Chapters report subscriptions to Veteran as Christmas
Gifts to each Confederate Soldier in their city.
Jefferson Davis Highway
A number of Chapters report progress and deep interest in this
project. Many have placed markers on the route. On June
3rd; Abbeville Chapter dedicated a beautiful marker on the spot
where President Jefferson Davis camped the night before his cap-
ture.
Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund
Georsria has contributed $323.50 during the year to this fund.
Each Chapter in Georgia does a large amount of relief work for
the local needy women of the Confederacy. Only one Georgia
woman receives monthly aid from the fund of the General Asso-
ciation.
Legislation
The two bills in which the Georgia Division was especially in-
terested both received favorable consideration at the hands of our
State Legislature. One was for an additional amount of $5000.00
to be appropriated for the maintenance fund for the Soldiers'
Home. This will enable the Trustees to make improvements need-

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 277
ed in the plumbing and also enable them to keep a graduate nurse
in addition to the two practical nurses now at the hospital.
The other bill was for an increase in the appropriation for the
work of the Georgia Soldier Roster Commission.
Although $1600 additional was asked for, we are grateful for the
$1000 given, making a total of $4600 for this work.
The Chairman for Better Moving Pictures reports satisfactory
progress in this department.
Historical Work
Georgia's Historian, Miss Mildred Rutherford, has established a
record for herself this year.
In addition to her monthly "Scrap Book'' she has written the
splendid pamphlet on "The Cross of Honor and the Cross of Serv-
ice," for the use of the contestants in our Essay Contest. Then
her crowning work of the year has been her Georgia History, now
in the printer's hands. It is hoped that this splendid work may
soon be in every Southern school as a text book.
Our Assistant Historian, Miss Lillie Martin, reports unusually
good work done by Chapters.
Number of Historical Meetings 711
Number of typed, printed and written pages of Historical
articles 3695
Number of talks by Daughters to schools 475
Number of Records of Confederate ancestors of members
of Chapters 1926
Number of Reminiscences of Confederate Veterans 305
Number of Historical edition of papers published by
Chapters 17
These are only a few of the splendid records she has sent in.
The "Last Cabinet Chapter'' of Washington, Ga., has sent a most
interesting map tracing President Davis' trip from Richmond until
he was captured, with dates and full history of events.
Some valuable relics have been collected and others located.
Georgia Division has established a fund for the use of our His-
torian. More than $500.00 was sent in by Chapters this past year
and $500.00 the year before. This will be used in publishing the
"Georgia History" just completed by our Historian, Miss Ruther-
ford.
Historical Essay Contest
Our Chairman reports a grand total of 27,462 essays written in
this contest, 64 prizes, 5 Stone Mountain coins and 100 medals
awarded. "The Cross of Honor and The Cross of Service" Droved
a subject of wide-spread interest. Many requests from World War
Veterans, and from Veterans of the Confederacy came to us for
pamphlets, besides requests for them of students who entered the
contest.


## p. 278 (#282) ############################################

278 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Scrap Book
Georgia Division is keeping a splendid Scrap Book and the work
of the chairman has been untiring. It is an immense, handsomely
bound volume, and contains historical information along all lines
connected with Georgia Daughters and their activities.
Women of the South in War Times
Georgia has not accomplished a great deal in selling "Women of
the South in War Times" for her obligation is a large one. At the
recent Convention in Sandersville, 100 copies were taken by Chap-
ters and this is in addition to those sold earlier in the year.
Woodrow Wilson Fund
The Woodrow Wilson Scholarship Fund is one in which Geor-
gia Division is very much interested, but on account of our own
State Funds for Education we have not made larger contributions.
In addition to the $55.00 already sent in, the Division authorized a
contribution of $145.00, making a total of $200.00 for this fund.
Text Books
Georgia Daughters are awakening to the necessity for Text Books
of a loyal and patriotic nature. The recent discussion that arose
over Gordy's History of the United States caused the author to
make some changes in the edition of 1925. We should see now that
the new edition is used.
The South must make its data available for the use of historians
and thus establish its records and its history.
Marking Historic Georgia
Most gratifying work has been accomplished by Georgia Divi-
sion in placing markers on graves of Confederate Veterans and on
historical spots throughout Georgia. In 1924, 784 markers were
placed on Veterans' graves, besides one Confederate Memorial and
four historic markers at a cost of $1525.00 Three county maps
were completed. Since then, 522 markers on Veterans' graves, and
8 boulders and monuments have been placed. In addition, one his-
toric building has been restored and one county map completed.
Our chairman is working especially to get counties to complete
maps showing the route of President Jefferson Davis in Georgia
before and after his capture in Irwinville.
Stone Mountain
Since February 25th no work has been done on Stone Mountain
Memorial. The affairs of the Stone Mountain Confederate Monu-
mental Association have been in a most unsettled condition and
funds sent to Chairman of the Georgia Division's Committee for
aiding the Memorial were returned to Chapters for deposit by
advice of Division President.

Education
Georgia continues its splendid educational work. Last year this
totalled more than $42,000.00. This year the grand total amounts
to close to $45,000.00, according to reports that come from our State
Chairman of Education. In addition to our two Division Loan
Funds, one for boys, and one for girls of Confederate lineage,
many individual Chapters have loan funds as well as gift scholar-
ships.
I am very gratified to report that during my two year term of
office, Georgia Division has completed its endowment for the Geor-
gia Room at Richmond, has paid its full pledge for the completion
of the Jefferson Davis Monument at- Fairview, Ky., and has paid
its part for the Maury Monument pledge.
In closing my stewardship of the affairs of the Georgia Divi-
sion, I look with pardonable pride on the splendid achievements
of the past two years. It has been a privilege to serve with such
devoted and efficient Division officers and chairmen. Each of them
and each Chapter has given enthusiastic co-operation at all times.
"And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
all."
Respectfully submitted,
RUBY JONES GRACE.

ter, bear evidence of much activity in their respective organiza-
tion.

Each "Dixie" member is pledged to earn 25c before Christmas
to replace the amount advanced from their Treasury. The chil-
dren also gave $5.00 for flowers on Memorial day and took part
in the services at the cemetery of our Confederate dead.
Our anniversary celebrations were splendid functions. The
Jefferson Davis anniversary was celebrated by Chicago Chapter
in the home of Mrs. A. O. Simpson, Stonewell Chapter being their
guests.
Another historical event was the dedication to Illinois Division
of Lottie K. Brown's illustrated lecture on "Robert E. Lee, Peerless
Military Leader.''
Under the leadership of Miss Ida F. Powell, impressive services
were held on Memorial day at Oakwood Cemetery.
Illinois Division bad a tree planted at the Higginsville Missouri
Confederate Soldiers Home.
Each Chapter is doing some relief work for war veterans. Chi-
cago Chapter has increased its monthly gift to the Confederate
Veterans at Richmond, Va., while Stonewall is ministering to her
World War veterans here in Chicago.
Our Treasurer, Mrs. W. L. Calloway, and our Director of Fi-
nance, Mrs. A. O. Simpson, keep us busy with many money-making
projects.
Our Division Director of Education, Mrs. Chas. H. Cook, regrets
to report the withdrawal by the University of Chicago of the

KENTUCKY DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy in Convention assembled:
Greetings from the Kentucky Division and best wishes for the
best Convention ever held in the history of the organization.
It is a great pleasure to report that our Division is moving for-
. ward in every department of work.
We have added 200 adults to the Division and 100 to the Children
of the Confederacy Auxiliary. Contributed our quota to the Needy
Confederate Women and lent aid to the Veterans.
Our pledge to the Kentucky Room at Richmond has been paid in
full. The pledge to Wilson Memorial ($100) and $100 to Essay En-
dowment Fund made at Savannah Convention has been met. The
Confederate Veteran has a good circulation in our Division. A rec-
ommendation was adopted at the Division Convention in October
to have a Veteran in every .Chapter and in all public libraries. The
full quota (182 copies) of "Women of the South in War Times,"
has been taken and check for same sent Treasurer-General. The
budget system of $2 per capita wjas adopted in 1923, the result of
which was reported by the treasurer, that after all obligations
have been met at the close of Convention in October, there was a
balance on hand of $1,000. Our Division is divided into five Dis-
tricts and a one-day session was held this year in all of the dis-
tricts with wonderful increase in interest, good fellowship and
membership. A silver loving cup, offered by the Division, was
awarded J. H. Morgan Chapter for greatest increase in membership
proportionately. A gold medal offered by the Division awarded
the A. J. Bedle C. of C. Auxiliary for the greatest increase in mem-
bership proportionately.
An appropriation of $143 was paid on completion of the founda-
tion of the Beauregard Monument at Camp Beauregard, Ky.
At the recent Division Convention a motion carried to introduce
a bill in the next General Assembly of Kentucky to make the birth-
day of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Memorial Day, President
Jefferson Davis Birthday, a legal state holiday.
Mrs. W. T. Fowler, President of Joseph Lewis Chapter, Frank-
fort, wrote a pageant presenting "Women of the South in War
Times," to be given by the Children of the Confederacy. The Nor-
man Remmington Publishing Co., has pubuished this in most at-

tractive style and copies were presented to Division Presidents and
General Officers and notice of dramatization to appear in Confed-
erate Veteran. It is hoped this will assist in the sale of our books.
One of the outstanding features of the Division Convention was
the splendid report that Mrs. Roy W. McKinney brought from the
General Convention at Savannah, Ga. Upon recommendation of the
President, adopted by the Division a gold medal will be given to
the Children's Chapter having the best historical work done dur-
ing the year.
An official Past President badge has been adopted on recommen-
dation of the President and will be conferred upon each retiring
President. An installation ritual recommended by the President
was adopted and a beautiful ritual service and pledges drafted by
a committee appointed with Mrs. McKinney, Chairman.
The initiation of a Chapter President's dinner and evening has
been an important feature of our Convention, which has not only
increased interest, but attendance. In fact, our Division Convention
is a miniature General Convention.
With best wishes to our much loved President-General and a
grateful appreciation of her untiring efforts to promote the best*
interest of our organization this report is
Respectfully submitted,
MRS. HARRY (ALLEEN) McCARTY,
President Kentucky Division.
LOUISIANA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
Another year has rolled on and has brought us together, a band
of women devoted to a cause than which no greater in the history
of the world has ever existed; the annals1 of the ages show upheav-
als, revolutions, riots, wars! but time has spread its mantle over
all but ONE; that ONE, the sacred cause of the Confederate States
of America! Why? "Why?" do you ask me? Because we fought—
not for gain, not for glory, not for aggrandizement, but in simple
obedience to duty to ourselves, to our country, to our great funda-
mental governing principle—the inalienable right of self govern-
ment; the right of the smaller nation to govern itself unmolested
by its greater neighbors; the principle unheld by Thomas Jeffer-
son, by Jefferson Davis, by Woodrow Wilson, and today the living
issue among the governments of the world.
Greetings
Today Louisiana greets you again, extending congratulations and
wishes for continued success in all your great undertakings. Tak-
ing up the line of march from Savannah onward, I report a de-
lightful visit to Stone Mountain, where I was received and enter-
tained by Mr. and Mrs. Borglum. The same evening I was a guest
of honor at the Henry Brady dinner—a most brilliant affair.

Christmas Cheer
Soon after reaching New Orleans, came our Christmas feast for
the soldiers—always our first care. The joy of Christmas, the
happy contented Veterans, the good things of life, both for the in-
ner and the outer man, made a combination picture which lingers
long in memory's hall. To Mrs. Rice, our custodian, all praise is
due; she never fails.
January 8th
This, the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, was cele-
brated by a banquet given at the Patio Royale, where gathered the
British and American Admirals, the consuls of seven nations, our
international Judge Crabites, resident of Egypt, with many men and
women distinguished in art, science and letters. Louisiana's Pres-
ident of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was the only
woman asked to give an address. The United Daughters of the
Confederacy thus received a distinctive honor, given to no other
woman's organized body. To the British Admiral, the lijje of Ju-
dah P. Benjamin, by Pierce Butler of Sophie Newcomb College,
was presented by Mrs. Tompkins.
Days of Observance
Birthdays of General Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Beauregard, Sem-
mes and others were fittingly observed, and marked by bestowals
of Crosses of Honor. At Memorial Hall, with its many relics, me-
mentoes, pictures and flags, so dear to the Veterans and Daughters,
We held these memorial ceremonies.
Louisiana Day
Under Mrs. Kolman, Chairman of Education, April 30th, is ob-
served by schools, where patriotic addresses" are made, and the
history, laws and development of Louisiana are stressed.
Coin Sale
In April we conducted for three weeks a strenuous campaign for
the sale of Stone Mountain coin, and succeeded fairly well. Hen-
ry Watkins, Allen Chapter, Baton Rouge, gave each Veteran a coin,
25 in all. The gift was a delight to each and every man.
Mansfield Convention
Usually we convene in May, but this year we advanced our date
to April, that we might celebrate the Anniversary of the Battle
of Mansfield, on April 8th. We unveiled one monument to Prince
de Polignac, and another to General Dick Taylor, heroes of the
Battles of Mansfield anct Pleasant Hill.
Rarely has come to a State the honor of unveiling two monu-
ments to two distinguished heroes, at the same time at the same
place; this honor came to Louisiana, when Victor Prince de Polig-
nac, accompanied by his charming mother, unveiled a monument to
his distinguished father, Prince de Polignac. Vive la France!


## p. 284 (#288) ############################################

284 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
The de Polignac monument had its incipience in the minds of
the Marquise de Courtivron, and Miss Mary Poppenheim as in
Paris, they sipped tea in the home of the former. The Paris Chap-
ter gave $1,000, and the balance was given by the United Daugh-
ters of the Confederacy.
The General Dick Taylor monument was unveiled the same day
by his grandson, Dick Taylor Stauffer; this monument was given
by General Taylor's two daughters, Mrs. Betty Taylor Stauffer, and
Mrs. Myrtle Taylor Stauffer, a crowning memorial to their Confed-
erate hero father.
So closed the Mansfield Convention—an event characterized by
its wonderful hospitality, its beautiful homes, its notable guests,
and its marvelous outpouring of the people of Louisiana.
Dallas Reunion
Soon after our Division Convention came the reunion of our
Veterans in the great State of Texas. I esteem it a privilege and a
pleasure to have participated in this great soul-stirring outpouring
at Dallas. Everybody took part! Everybody entertained, for the
guests of Dallas! Everybody danced! Everybody sang! Every-
body verified the old saying, "One touch of Nature makes the
whole kin." My verdict is, "A perfect reunion of the men and wom-
en of Dixie."
Return of Louisiana Tigers Flag
In May a delegation of the Grand Army of the Republic was au-
thorized by the Convention Legislature to return to the Louisiana
Tigers their flag, captured during the War; this ceremony took
place at Memorial Hall. Not a man of the Tigers was found to
accept the flag; but the occasion was impressive and touching and
it was enlivened by many social ftinctions, and by the profound
and abiding sentiments of good will.
Many delightful social features leave their pleasant memories
with the Louisiana Daughters as they meet from time to time in
loving reunion.
Bishop Beverly Tucker
A notable event occurred October 21st, when Bishop Beverly
Tucker, of Virginia, prominent as the only Confederate Soldier
Bishop, spoke to the Veterans of his Army life in Virginia; he gra-
ciously shook the hand of each and every gray-clad man, when
many eyes were dim with tears, for all felt the benediction of this
venerable man of God.
Princess de Polignac
Our French guests were given a charming afternoon by Mrs.
Geo. Denegre, and were received with loyalty and enthusiasm by
the Veterans, many of whom had served under Prince de Polignac
at Mansfield.
United States Navy Band
The Business and Professional Women's Club extended an invi-
tation to the Veterans for a concert November 15th. To this en-

your next Convention. Some of us stand facing the rising sun—
others stand in the full noontime of his glory, while others are
watching the shadows grow long on the wall. But young or old,
rich or poor, highborn or lowly, we stand united in one great com-
mon cause—the uplift of our beloved Southland, the education of
her people, the preservation of her sacred memories, and her holy
traditions.
And, my countrywomen, the South is coming into her own! For
"The Star of Empire Southward takes its flight," and we—we stand
in the blazing light of that Star, whose refulgent glory shines upon
the South, a vital force in the Great Union of States. The United
States! The colossus of the Western World, which with one foot
planted upon the.eternal snows of the Arctic, the other deep-buried
in the verdure of the Amazonian forests, bestrides the Western
Hemisphere, and in the interest of World Peace, cries to the Na-
tions of the Earth saying, "So far shalt thou go, and no farther."

acy:
I bring you greetings from Maryland Division and beg to submit
the following: In the beginning of the year I sent a circular let-
ter to all Chapters Presidents in the Division outlining the work I
hoped they would accomplish and giving a list of the pledges made
at the General Convention. In September I issued another one to

the Chapter Presidents requesting them to check over the pledges
and see if all contributions had been made and taxes paid.
History
We feel proud of our progress in Historical work. The desire
of our organization to place true history before the people is one
that should not be disregarded. Our Division Historian has, with
the assistance of Mrs. Charles E. Parr, Honorary President of the
Division, and the Chapter Presidents, compiled and put in pam-
phlet form a true history of the Organization of the Maryland Di-
vision and the Chapters in the Division, giving the day and year
of their organization, names of the first officers, list of names on
the application for Charter, and a brief account of the military
record of the officer for whom their Chapter is named. One copy
was sent to the President-General, and one to the Historian-Gener-
al. In May, 1925, the Henry Kyd Douglas Chapter, Hagerstown
produced the Yale University Press Film, "Dixie," to an audience
of 1600 people. Located in a border town we feel this was of in-
estimable value as among our audience were a large number of
teachers and pupils from the public and private schools in Wash-
ington County. October 27, this Chapter entertained the visitors
to the annual Convention which w<as held October 28, with an open
meeting which was of great historical value. Capt. John Kyd
Beckenbaugh, a nephew of General Henry Kyd Douglas, made the
address and exhibited several relics that had been the property of
his uncle. Among them was a hand glass and a little black trunk
that had accompanied Gen. Douglas throughout the War Between
the States. Capt Beckenbaugh said he was proud to be a South-
erner but he was prouder still that he had the honor to be the
nephew of a man who had served on the Staff of General "Stone-
wall" Jackson.
At our Convention, on motion of Mrs. Jackson Brandt, the Di-
vision decided to present a Sword to West Point, as a prize in hon-
or of the memory of General Robert E. Lee. Historical papers are
read at all Chapter meetings.
Education
Under our Director, Miss Harriet Marine, we have made great
progress in our educational work. You have heard her report
through the General Chairman. We are so happy to have been
awarded the full Tuition Scholarship at Washington and Lee, for
Mr. Robert B. Lee of Bel Air, Md.
Our Division has created a scholarship at Goucher College, Bal-
timore, to honor the memory of one of Maryland's representative
women and a loyal Daughter of the late Mrs. John P. Poe. This
is called the Annie Johnson Poe Memorial Scholarship value $250.00
a year. The Director for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Fund re-
ports $276.00 contributed.
The report of our Director for our book, "Women of the South in
War Times," shows that she has disposed of 11 copies, amounting
to $20.00. Total of Educational work is $2,779.23.

Jefferson Davis Highway
Greater interest in this splendid Memorial has been shown by
the Chapters this year due to the untiring efforts of our Director,
Mrs. Chas. E. Parr.
Crosses of Honor
Our Recorder of Crosses of Honor and Director of World War
Records reports the bestowal of 15 Crosses of Honor, and 24 Cross-
es of Service.
We have 43 subscribers to the Confederate Veteran.
Our Director for the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund, re-
ports $273.00 contributed this year.
Registration
I have signed 80 Certificates of Membership, and our Registrar
reports 8 Chapters in the Division, and 835 active registered mem-
bers on the Division file.
Children of the Confederacy
Our Third Vice-President, Director C. of C., reports 3 Chapters
in the Division with 53 members registered.
Benevolence
The award of a pension by the Organization to a native and resi-
dent of Maryland, the widow of a Confederate Veteran, has given
me great pleasure. Mrs. Bowling, 77 years of age, was without
means to provide herself with any comforts or necessities of life.
She has just received her second check and writes me that "this
act of kindness to a helpless widow by the Daughters of the Con-
federacy will be remembered during her life, and if such a thing
is possible her feeling of devotion and gratitude will extend be-
yond the grave.''
Memorial
On June 3, a Memorial Meeting was held at the Hotel Belvedere,
Baltimore. An interesting program was arranged by Miss Sally
Washington Maupin and Crosses of Honor and of Service were be-
stowed through Baltimore Chapter No. 8. We were honored by hav-
ing in the audience the ladies from the Confederate Women's Home,
and a number of Confederate Veterans. Dr. Henry Wharton made
the invocation and sang The Bonnie Blue Flag; Dr. Henry Shepherd
made an interesting address and General Milton Reckord and
Lieut-Commander Richard E. Byrd, also united with us in paying
tribute to the memory of our President of the Confederacy, Mr.
Jefferson Davis.
I am happy to state that the objects for which we are organized
have all been observed in my year of service.
Respectfully submitted,
(MRS FRANKLIN P.) MARY G. CANBY,
Retiring President Maryland Division.

Boston Chapter
Madam President-General and the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy in Convention:
I bring you loyal greetings from the Boston Chapter.
• Though we are in the midst of opposition we feel that some bar-
riers are being lowered with the invitation of the Governor of Mas-
sachusetts to the Chapter President to become a member of the
State Committee, with the heads of other Patriotic organizations
"To Save the Constitution," "Old Ironsides," which was accepted
—and through the unveiling of a Tablet to the Confederate Sol-
dier by the surviving members of a G. A. R. Post at Oak Bluffs,
Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts on September 4th, when as Pres-
ident of the Boston Chapter I carried greetings of the Chapter and
spoke a few words in recognization of this splendid accomplish-
ment. An account of the unveiling was in the Veteran for Octo-
ber.
At the October meeting a Cross of Honor was presented to Mr.
Charles Strahan by the President on behalf of the Chapter. Mr.
Strahan was the Confederate Veteran who accepted the Tablet to
the Confederate Soldiers at Oak Bluffs.
As has been the custom of the Chapter in the past to give $60
toward the expenses of a Veteran to the reunion, it was our pleas-
ure to give this sum to our own Veteran, Mr. Nat Poyntz, of Bos-
ton, who is the only Confederate Veteran on active duty rolls of
the United States Army, a Veteran of three (3) wars and proudly
boasts of never having surrendered to anybody or anything. He
is over 80 years old.
Our Hospital work continues and we find many Southern lads in
the Marine Hospital, Chelsea, who look forward to our visits with
eagerness.
A revision of Chapter By-laws was made and will soon be in
the hands of the printers. A Corresponding Secretary and Parlia-
mentarian have been added to the list of officers and appointments.
The Historical program, owing to lack of references makes it
impossible to follow very closely. The Chapter has purchased for
the Historian "Robert E. Lee, The Soldier," by Brigadier-General
Sir Frederic Maurice.
On January 20th the anniversaries of General Robert E. Lee, Gen-
eral "Stonewall" Jackson and Commander Matthew Fontaine Mau-
ry were fittingly observed. The speakers were Hon. Edward
"Woodhouse, a Virginian, and former Mayor of Northampton, Mas-
sachusetts, and present holder of the chair of Political History at
Smith College, also Brigadier-General Sir Frederic Maurice, who
was giving a series of lectures at Lowell Institute, Boston, on Gen-
eral Lee.

Another interesting program at a later date was given by Capt.
H. H. Bailey, grandnephew of Jefferson Davis.
On May 10th, the Chapter was represented at the celebration of
Mother's Day on the Boston Common held annually by the Volun-
teers of America.
On Memorial Day, May 30th, flags and wreaths were placed at
Deer Island and Forest Hills. There are three Confederates buried
in Worchester and through the efforts of a Southern Woman, hop-
ed to have flags and markers, but the authorities refused as they
did in New Hampshire where there is one.
Our Comrades grave in Forest Hills has been put in order and
will ever be the loving care of the Boston Chapter.
Our Book, "The Women of the South in War Times," has met
with some success privately and with one copy at Smith College
and one in a public school library.
The Jefferson Davis Highway Map is displayed at several sum-
mer resorts and colleges.
The Chairman of Education works very hard to obtain scholar-
ships for students with no encouragement.
A special plea was made at one of our meetings for Mrs. Norman
V. Randolph's Relief Work bv the Chapter Chairman and over
$25.00 raised.
$200.00 the proceeds of the May dance given by the Southern Club
of Boston, was most generously given to the Boston Chapter for the
Veterans, of which $40.00 was sent to the Confederate Home at
Pikesville, Maryland, $80.00 to North Carolina and $80.00 to Mrs.
Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund.
The President of the Boston Chapter has been made an honor-
ary member of the Southern Club of Boston, during her term of
office.
The Children of the Confederacy are as enthusiastic as ever with
19 enrolled.
The Chapter has met all its obligations and contributed to the
following:
For Veteran to reunion $ 60.00
Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund 150.00
Jefferson Davis Highway 50.00
Woodrow Wilson Endowment 25.00
To the Prize Fund 10.00
Given by the Southern Club of Boston 200.00

Robert E. Lee Chapter, Minneapolis
Dear Madam President-tGeneral and Members of the Daughters of
the Confederacy:
The pleasure is mine again to extend cordial greetings and to say
that we are with you in spirit, if not in body, for our little Robert
E. Lee Chapter, away up here in the North is still holding its own,
although the growth is slow. We have this year taken in four new
members and not one. has dropped from our ranks. Although we
lost a former member, Mrs. Margaret Greaves Winslow, and also
our one lone Confederate Veteran, who died in the spring. We
remembered him at Christmas with a box of fruits and candies
and the yearly subscription to the Confederate Veteran.
Thisyear we have observed the birthday of General Robert E.
Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Admiral Semmes with interesting Histor-
ical programs given in the homes of our members and each enter-
tainment was befitted to a memory of our Southland's Chieftains.
At present our treasury shows something like $50; we have con
tributed to a few little charitable Southern organizations and to
the Pee Wee Valley Home we sent $10 and to the Higginsville Home
we sent $10. Both of these contributions were mailed in time to
reach them for Christmas day.
Hoping this year will bring us all prosperity and a growing
membership.

I am glad to be here this evening as the representative of the
Mississippi Division, glad to bring to you a loving greeting from
the Daughters _of the "Old Magnolia State," and to assure you "Mis-
sissippi is marching on—a best beloved State and will take her
place with Southern grace among the greatest of the great.''
Assuming the office of President in May and as the majority of
the Chapters are inactive during the summer months, my report
will necessarily be short. Our executive board at a meeting in
June, outlined the work for the year. We decided to request all
schools in the State to pay a special tribute to Jefferson Davis on
Mississippi day, December 10th, as President Davis' birthday comes
after our schools close for the summer vacation. With all due re-

spect for Lincoln we are willing to give honor where honor is
due, still we feel our Mississippi children, along with other South-
ern children, are having too much of Lincoln and not enough of
Davis.
We also decided to have a get-to-gether meeting one day of our
State Fair in Jackson. Friday, October 23, was decided on as the
time. Mrs. C. G. Gellespie, our 2nd vice-President, was asked to
arrange for this meeting;. She did so in a very efficient way, se-
curing the reception room of the Y. W. C. A., and sent out invi-
tations through Chapter Presidents to all Daughters who would
attend the Fair to call between 11 and 1 o'clock to meet the Divi-
sion officers. Our object was to meet each other and know each
other better, and to discuss our problems. This meeting was a
success in spite of the very inclement weather and attendance not
what we expected, as many had planned to come in cars. The of-
ficers had lunch together and had an opportunity to talk over the
work we hoped to accomplish. I had typewritten lists of things
I wanted Chapters to do and gave to each Chapter represented and
mailed to Chapters not represented. This list was headed, "What
CAN you do to help your Division? Check off and return to your
President.''
Pay Division tax.
Pay General tax.
Support Our Heritage—by sending in subscription list.
Support Educational work.
Contribute to State Work Fund—(to pay back debts.)
Contribute to Maintenace Fund.
Organize a New Chapter.
Revive an old Chapter.
Name school for a Confederate Hero.
Place Our Heritage, Confederate Veteran and Southern books in
school or city library.
Mark historical place in your community.
(Especially along Jefferson Davis Highway.)
Furnish flowers for one bed at Beauvoir Soldiers' Home.
Honor President Davis in some public way—if you did not ob-
serve Mississippi Day in school.
Send delegates to Division Convention.
Follow work outlined by our Historian.
Use year book—send in essays, etc.
Buy book, "The Women of the South in War Times."
Help with Memorial Coin sales.
What general work are you interested in and will contribute to?
My first duty as Division President was meeting with the C. of
C. to help organize them into a State organization. It was indeed
encouraging to meet with this band of enthusiastic young people
and realize what reinforcement our organization has in our C. of C.
—like Church and State our organization depends on the youth of
the land for life and growth. Mrs. Burney is truly the Pandora of
our Division holding the children—our hope—before it is too late.
During the summer I had the pleasure of visiting a number of the
Chapters. I found the Chapters on the coast very enthusiastic
over the idea of marking the Historical spots along our Mississippi
coast. Also in getting the Jefferson Davis Highway completed
through a few counties where it has not yet been finished. Steph-

en D. Lee Chapter at Laurel, one of our largest Chapters, has
adopted the plan of working in circles—each circle holding its
meeting and reporting once a month in a general meeting.
The Chapters most active in presenting the Cross of Service are
Jno. M. Stone Chapter of West Point, Stephen D. Lee Chapter of
Columbus, the Vicksburg Chapter, General Calvin Brooks Vance
Chapter of Batesville, and J. Z. George Chapter, Greenwood.
The R. E. Lee Chapter, Aberdeen, won the Mississippi State Flag
offered to the Chapter doing the best work. Among other note-
worthy things they did was the marking of 78 soldiers' graves
with headstones.
In educational work we are, as in the past, supporting two
scholarships at our M. S. C. W. in addition to the Margaret Howell
Davis Hays Memorial scholarship. We have a student at Gulf Park
College and one at Millsaps. A number of scholarships are given
by Chapters and individuals. Medals are given by the Division
and Chapters for best essays written by children of the schools.
We still continue to publish a Division paper, "Our Heritage," a
monthly periodical which we find of much help in carrying on our
work.
The work that appeals most to all the Chapters and to which
they give their hearty support is the Maintenances Fund—to care
for the Veterans and wives of Veterans outside of our home. This
fund amounts to $2,000 or more a year. This department is in the
capable hands of Mrs. L. P. Yearger of Greenwood. I have visited
Jefferson Davis Soldiers' Home, Beauvoir, and talked to the Veter-
ans.
I also attended the State reunion U. C. V., at Meridian where I
had the privilege of delivering the Memorial address. I have made
talks to a number of schools, explaining to the children why we
did not want them to say Civil War and "Lost Cause." Have also
asked the co-operation of some of the prominent editors of the
State in using the term War Between the States instead of Civil
War. Our President went before the Book Commissioner and made
an appeal for a better history in our schools. We asked that thev
adopt Hall Smither and Ousley's instead of Mace Putrie now used.
Our request was not granted but we are still working on this and
hope to make the, change. We feel some good was accomplished
and our appeal interested our teachers over the State and they dis-
cussed Southern literature and history at their State meeting. I
am glad to report to you that Mississippi Daughters are still heed-
ing the Lord's Command to Joshua to mark the historic places with
stones. Two Chapters have erected monuments this year—Belzoni
and Poplarville. I had the pleasure of delivering the address at
the unveiling of the Humphreys County monument at Belzoni.
Here's to historic Mississippi with her legends
Rich and rare, with romance and with story'
And her statesmen great in glory
With their goodly deeds her share.
Respectfully submitted,
MRS. T. B. HOLLOMAN,
Division President.

294 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
MISSOURI DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
The grand old State of Missouri brings happy greeting to the
Daughters assembled in Hot Springs, Arkansas, our own sister
state joined to us by many ties.
We have closed a year in which there has been so much joy
and success, such happy comradeship and co-operation in advanc-
ing the work of our loved cause.
On October 21-23, we held in St. Louis, one of the most success-
ful Conventions ever held in our State—large attendance and
splendid work reported from all Chapters and committees. As
guests of the five St. Louis Chapters nothing was left undone to
make our stay one of delight and perfect happiness.
Our Veterans, who come first with us, have had loving care all
over our State. Our splendid chairman of "Men and Women of the
Sixties," Mrs. John F. Waite, sent out letters to the Chapters last
Christmas to make the Christmas of 1924 an individual one, en-
closing the name of each resident of the home at Higginsville; the
response was so great the Superintendent remarked he was com-
pletely "snowed under," for nearly 1900 presents came into the
Home—and as one old Veteran remarked, "This seems more like
Christmas before the War than ever before." As package after
package was unwrapped the old people were speechless, until one
dear old sainted woman commenced to sing "Praise God From
Whom All Blessings Flow." We wish to thank the Robert E. Lee
Chapter of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for joining us in this great
Christmas. This was followed by a turkey dinner with all the
trimmings.
During the year we have had Valentine parties. Easter parties,
Home-coming parties, and on Memorial Day, June 3, we celebrated
the birthday of Jefferson Davis with a beautiful program, after
which the 650 graves at the Home were decorated with small Con-
federate flags. As number of Chapters gave semi-annual dinners
to the Veterans in their midst.
The care of our cemetery at Higginsville this year has been fi-
nanced by 10% per capita tax, which has kept it in a perfect con-
dition, and one of the great accomplishments of the year was the
turning over to the Daughters, by the old Board of the Home, the
monev held by them to place markers; this will be sufficient for
all who are at the Home at the present time, amounting to nearly
.¥2600.00.
The State of Missouri has spent nearly $30,000 in repairs on the
Home this year thereby making it one of the most beautiful Homes
in the entire country.
On each Decoration Day the five Chapters of St. Louis decorated
1500 graves of Confederates buried at Jefferson Barracks.

Mrs. George F. Longan, a most able chairman of the "Women of
South In War Times," has sold 100 books this year—a splendid
achievement! Twenty Crosses of Service have been conferred, and
seventy-eight Crosses of Honor. This does not mean that we are
negligent in this work, but nearly all our Veterans have Crosses.
Our Educational work has had a most wonderful increase, the
value of which is $8062.77 in loan and gift scholarships. The Di-
vision voted this year to establish a gift scholarship in the School
of the Ozarks, to be given to the boy or girl who is a descendant
from a Confederate Veteran. Nine Chapters already have nine
scholarships in this school.
We have given this year to the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship
$555.90.
Our Historian, Mrs. A. C. Meyer, reports much splendid historical
work done in the past year, much interest is being shown by
Chapters in compiling scrap books, a prize being given each year
for the best scrap book. A large number of Southern books have
been placed in schools, local libraries this year, also many pictures
hung in public buildings.
Mrs. W. G. Curd, Chairman of Museum at State Capitol, Jefferson
City, reports many additions to the Museum this year. We hope
to make this a splendid collection as 31,000 persons passed through
the Capitol during the past year.
Mrs. George H. Baxter, Director of C. of C. Chapters has organ-
ized one new Chapter—the Robert E. Lee of Sedalia. The Captain
Sally Tompkins C. of C. Chapter, Springfield, hung Woodrow Wil-
son's portrait in the High School; placed "Women of the South in
War Times," in the public library. The Betty S. Robert Chapter,
C. of C. of St. Louis, gave a prize of $5.00 for the best essay on any
Southern patriot.
Several Chapters are in process of organization but my greatest
ambition is to present to the General Organization a Chapter in
Hawaii, for which papers were sent six weeks ago.
A number of Chapters paid the expenses of Veterans to the re-
union at Dallas, Texas. The five Kansas City Chapters entertained
the Veterans at their State reunion in September.
Twenty-six Chapters from Missouri were represented at the
Dallas reunion in May; at this reunion I had the honor of being
appointed Chairman of chaperons by General A. A. Pearson, Com-
mander S. C. V. of Missouri; Colonel and Chief of Staff, by General
W. H. Harrelson" Commander of the Western Brigade; a member of
reception committee by General R. H. Snead, Commander of the
Trans-Mississippi Department.
No one on our Official Board has done more efficient service
than our own Mrs. J. T. McMahon in her press work, never fail-
ing to have some interesting items in Confederate Veteran each
month.
Thirty-four Chapters out of the forty-six are 100%—that is, giv-
ing to every cause.
Every Chapter except one celebrated the birthdays of Robert E.
Lee and Stonewall Jackson.

296 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
One of the crowning joys and honors that came to the Missouri
Division this year was the joy of having a visit from our beloved
President-General, Mrs. Frank Harrold, in May, she being the guest
of the five Kansas City Chapters, at a Luncheon at the Bellerieve.
We have lost many of our splendid Veterans this year, among
them being General J. T. Holland, Commander of the Eastern Bri-
gade, General W. H. Harrelson, Commander of the Western Bri-
gade, and our own iDr. Stephen Hood Ragan, son of a Veteran. At
his death he held the high position of Surgeon-General.
We feel the greatest event that has come into the history of our
Daughters this year was the setting aside at the Confederate Home
at Higginsville ninety-one acres by the State as a Memorial Park,
to be dedicated to the valor of the Confederate soldier. This was
done in February. I appointed a committee consisting of my three
Vice-Presidents to solicit trees and plants. In two short months
there were 2000 plants and shrubs planted in the park. Seven
lakes have been made, artistic drives laid out and completed
through the park, a splendid large greenhouse built with all mod-
ern equipment. We expect to make this one of the beauty spots
of the United States.
I wish to acknowledge special gifts to the park from out of the
State by the following: Mrs. Frank Harrold, President-General;
Mrs. J. T. Beal, 1st Vice-President-General; Mrs. St. John A. Law-
ton, Historian-General; the Utah Division, Georgia Division, North
Carolina Division, Illinois Division, Montana Division, New Mex-
ico, North Dakota, South Carolina Division, Kansas and West Vir-
ginia Division.
In looking over the reports of Chapters I wish I might be given
space to tell of their splendid work; it has been magnificent.
I reported last year that we had closed our books with the larg-
est balance of any year, but we are still better this year. With all
obligations paid we have a balance of $3,091,41 wfth a $1,000.00
Liberty Bond.
Pledging anew the loyalty and love of Missouri and thanking
each State for the many courtesies extended, and with a wish that
this may be the very best Convention ever held, I am
Fraternally yours,

Our membership is steadily growing as the scope of our work in-
creases and, although our band is still small, it abounds with en-
thusiasm in our great work.
On the twenty-first of January we celebrated the birthdays of
Generals Lee and Jackson and of Matthew Fontaine Maury at our
annual Guest-Day. Our chaplain, Mr. C. Everard Deems, spoke to
us of the life and attainments of Maury. Mrs. Livingston Rowe
Schuyler, our beloved god-mother, who was our guest of honor,
told us of her mission to England when she presented the bust
of Lee to the War College there. Jefferson Davis' birthday was
remembered at a luncheon in June.
Our contributions during the year include $200.00 to Stone Moun-
tain, $100.00 as a scholarship at Peabody College for Teachers,
$25.00 to Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund, $25.00 to Wood-
row Wilson Scholarship Fund, $10.00 to Jefferson Davis Highway,
$10.00 to Maury Monument and $36.18 to a needy Daughter of the

Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-

Love and greetings from the New York Division. Another busy
year has come and gone and the Division feels that the interest
and zeal with which the Chapters have worked will count in the
annals of the organization; of their energy and serious thought
they have given freely. The Chapters increase their numbers
somewhat yearly and while the New York Division is small, we
like to feel that we bear our share of the burden. Working in this
great metropolis in some respects is more difficult as people are
literally scattered to the four winds, the distances are so great.
The dear children of the Confederacy form a very interesting fea-
ture of the work. The Division Roll shows sixty-three members.
The Division selects pages for the Division Convention from
the Children's Chapters in order to familiarize them with the
organization's aims, and they show great interest and apti-
tude. In this way they fall in line and learn to be officers lit-
tle by little. The Division Treasurer's report for the year to-
tals $13,963.04. The educational report, literary and vocal scholar-
ships, endowments, books, pictures, objects of art, etc., $38,027.48

gion will surely find reward. The Division acknowledges with
great appreciation the earnest co-operation of the Chapters and
general accord. It is with great sadness we report the names of
those who have fallen asleep: Mrs. L. D. Alexander, Mrs. A. G.
Brewster, Mrs. John Sargent Wise, Mrs. Julia Burton Loomis, Miss
Lulu V. Quigg, Miss Elizabet.h Wood, Mrs. Eugene Frayer; Mrs. W.
A. Parrish, associates Major William S. Keily, Mr. James Roach,
Dr. LeRoy Broun.
The Chapters have entertained as usual during the year: Mrs.
Algernon, Sullivan on her 89th birthday entertained Mary Mildred
Sullivan Chapter in her home. Mrs. Alfred Wellborn Cochran,
Honorary President of the New York Chapter, United Daughters of
the Confederacy, entertained on Washington's birthday at the
Plaza. The Past President-General, Mrs. Livingston Rowe Schuyler,
entertained as usual on Founders' Day at the Roosevelt. Mrs. James
Henry Parker, President of the New York Chapter, gave her usual
reception to members and guests in January. On January 19th the
Confederate Veterans held their usual campfire in celebration of
General Lee's birthday, which was most interesting. Mary Mil-
dred Sullivan Chapter presented eighteen Crosses of Service and
one Cross of Honor." The New York Chapter presented a Cross of
Honor. A very brilliant and informative speech, given by Major
Bouvier. Supper and dancing /followed.
The Chapter.s having subscribed the amount necessary, for Dr.
Rowland's Book, "Jefferson Davis Constitutionalist," the Division
presented it to the University of New York. The book is really
beautiful, depicting Mr. Davis from his early manhood to his last
days, and in each volume a portrait of him at that stage of his
life and activities. The Division card party on February I2th,
notwithstanding the usual storm on that day, was well attended
and proceeds gratifying. Mrs. Charles H. Topping entertained her
Chapter and friends in her own home. The New York Chapter
card party was successful socially and financially, and a second
Division card party, though small, brought good results. The an-
nual luncheon of the New York Chapter was, as usual, enthusias-
tically attended. The Past President-General, Presidents of all the
Chanters, Commanders of the Confederate Veterans and Sons of
the Confederate Veterans, as guests. The United Daughters of the
Confederacy took an active part in the first Southern Exposition
in New York, which marked a new era of prosperity and good
will. When I acted as hostess I welcomed many of my northern
friends. The "Largest Book in the World" attracted crowds and
great interest, as well as many other exhibits.
From the unveiling of the monument of Prince de Polignac, the
Princess de Polignac and her son, Prince Jacques de Polignac,
stopped in New York enroute for France. The New York Division
sent to the ship a beautiful floral tribute, with the colors of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy, the flags of the United States.
France and the Confederacy. She wrote a most grateful note of
annreciation to the Division and said the flowers had cheered them
all the way over.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 299
The usual memorial services to the Veterans at Mount Hope cem-
etery were held the last Sunday in May. An address by Command-
er Selvage, a tribute to the late Commander William S. Keily by
Mrs. Schuyler. Music by the quartette, prayers by the Chaplain,
Rev. Nathan Seagle, the wreaths sent by the Grand Army of the
Republic, amid the flowers and wreaths of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy—gave food for thought.
With a prayer in my heart for this great work that it may grow
and expand with each coming year, that we may work to the great
end with unremitting zeal and courage and always find a way to
help those who need help, this report is respectfully submitted.

NORTH DAKOTA
Robert E. Lee Chapter
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
The Robert E. Lee Chapter United Daughters of the Confederacy,
was organized on June third, 1924, upon Jefferson Davis' birthday.
There were thirteen Charter members. The Chapter has increas-
ed from thirteen to twenty members during its first and second
year. We have lost a very distinguished member, Mrs. Parks Fish-
er, (sister of Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley) by death. She
was a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, but in order to help the
new Chapter get started joined as a charter member out here.
The new Chapter (the first in this State) is growing, for four
have made application for membership (one of these living in Bis-
mark and two ladies from Grand Forks have been proposed for
membership.) We are working and hoping to have a Division be-
fore many years.
We met the second Wednesday in each month and our meetings
are well attended. We certainly enjoy seeing each other and talk-
ing over our homes in the South. We have had a number of dis-
tinguished men address the Daughters upon different educational
topics.
We are very much interested in the work the National Organiza-
tion is doing and want to take part in all the work planned by
them.
We have contributed our quota to the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph
Fund, $5.00. To the Jefferson Davis Highway we sent $5.00. Eight
members are subscribing to the Confederate Veteran.
Three volumes of the "Women of the South in War Times" have
been purchased, one of them by the Chapter and placed in the
Fargo Library. Another has just been ordered by one of the mem-
bers. A copy of General Lee's book ($5.00) has been purchased by
the Chapter and each member is planning to read it in turn.

300 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
A tree, a North Dakota linden, was sent from Fargo to the Me-
morial Home in Missouri.
Two members are subscribing to the Dixie Magazine. We are
planning to place several books in foreign libraries. We hope to
have a benefit bridge for the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship Fund
and other work soon.
Several children of members have been enrolled on the Chil-
dren's Founders Roll for the Stone Mountain Memorial.
We have had many very interesting meetings, among them one
in which we brought all our most prized heirlooms and family
silver, pictures, shawls and lovely old lace to show to each other.
Every one brought something and told the rest about it. We had
another very interesting meeting in which each member told of
"Some historic incident that happened in my town.''
We are soon to have a very interesting address by one of the
Professors from the Agricultural College upon "Southern Architec-
ture."
We hope as we grow older to accomplish a great deal more but
we feel that the year has been well worth while from every stand-
point.
Please call on us for help in every great enterprise as we would
indeed like to help even if it is only in a small way in the begin-
ning. We want to feel ourselves a part of your great plan.
With all good wishes for a most successful Convention.
Most sincerely,
PHOEBE FROST COULTER,
(Mrs. John Lee)
President Robert E. Lee Chapter.
NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
North Carolina Division wishes to report to you a year of en-
thusiastic efforts and splendid achievements.

Chapters have been organized during the past year, adding 663
new members.
Relief Work

man's Home in Fayetteville come splendid reports of the gener-
osity and thoughtfulness evinced by the Daughters of North Car-
olina during the past year. Boxes of canned goods, groceries,

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 301
No cause appeals more strongly to North Carolina Daughters
than the relief of Confederate Women living in the far North and
West, dependent upon Daughters of the Confederacy. A total of
$280.00 was pledged to the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund
by the Division, and $70.00 pledged by individuals. Total amount
raised for this Fund being $500.00.
For the Bessie Beall Reid Bed, maintained by this Division at the
State Tubercular Sanitorium, a total of $490.30 has been raised
and several most worthy patients have been restored to health
the past year.
Educational
North Carolina Division maintains a fine list of scholarships—
twenty in total, besides those maintained by Districts and Chap-
ters. The Children of the Confederacy of North Carolina main-
tain three scholarships. For Education the Division has expended
this year $2,691.67.
Much enthusiasm was felt by North Carolina Delegates to Sa-
nannah last year in the movement to establish a scholarship in the
University of Virginia, as a Memorial to Hon. Woodrow Wilson.
To this effort the Division pledged $1,000.00, and interested Chap-
ters and individuals added to this pledge amounting to $525.00,
making a total of $1,525.00 pledged. How hearty has been the re-
sponse to the call to meet this pledged you will realize when I
report to you the sum raised—$1,759.05.
The Division has been so interested in the effort to establish a
Fellowship at Randolph-Macon in honor of Mrs. Cornelia Branch
Stone, a Resolution to this effect being presented by Mrs. R. P.
Holt of North Carolina at General Convention last year .To this
Fund has been contributed $399.50.
An Educational effort that has been an obligation on this Di-
vision for several years is the book, "Women of the South in War
Times." At the beginning of the year there were still 361 copies
to be sold. Through the untiring efforts of our Director and the
desire of loyal North Carolina Daughters to complete the quota,
the goal has been reached. North Carolina has gone "Over the
Top," with a few' additional copies to our credit. A total of 1509
books have been bought by the Division. $53.50 has been sent to
the Publicity Fund.
Historical
This has been a most fruitful year in the Historical Department
of the Division. At our recent Convention it was decided to es-
tablish a Special Fund to be used for Historical work in the Di-
vision. There is keen interest in the Historical Foundation and to
this has been contributed $465.50. 207 subscriptions have been sent
in to the Confederate Veteran.
Memorial
Last year this Division reported all permanent markers on the
Jefferson Davis Highway through North Carolina, bought, paid for,
and in place. Plans are now made to beautify it. Some planting
has already been done.

302 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
A monument to Veterans of Stanly County was unveiled at Al-
bemarle. Funds to the amount of $475.60 have been pledged to
buy a Die "General Lee on Traveller" to be used for marking the
Dixie Highway in North Carolina.
The sum of $160.50 has been sent to aid in the purchase of Mon-
ticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.
2,957 Rolls of Honor have been sent from North Carolina to the
Confederate Museum at Richmond. For the preservation of the
Battle of Bentonville Grounds $74.00 has been contributed.
An outstanding effort this year has been the issuance of the
Gettysburg supplement published as a special edition to the News
& Observer, one of the State's leading papers and containing an
interesting arrangement of historical material concerning North
Carolina's part at Gettysburg. Through the sale of this supple-
ment $582.65 has been raised for our Gettysburg Monument Fund.
The total to date for this fund being $7,040.16.
At our recent Convention our Gettysburg Monument effort was
voted the main work of North Carolina Division for the coming
year. 43 Crosses of Honor were bestowed and 81 Crosses of Serv-
ice.
To encourage the activities of the Division, generous friends and
Daughters offered prizes totalling $630.00 in gold, besides banners,
medals, and loving cups. For all purposes a total of $23,738.10 has
been raised and $19,362.32 has been expended.
Total available assets—$12,477.78.
Bereavements
North Carolina Division has been saddened the past year by the
loss of two of our splendid ex-presidents. After months of weary
suffering, Mrs. Thomas W. Wilson and Mrs. E. H. Morrison passed
to the Great Beyond. They labored in faith, wrought mightily and
we rejoice in what they achieved. This Division mourns their
death and will ever honor and reverence them.
A number of faithful Daughters and a long list of Veterans have
been called from us.
Our Division Convention was held in Elizabeth City on October
21st to 23rd, and was most inspiring. Many forward plans were
adopted.
Madam President-General, as a parting word, representing the
North Carolina Division, may I assure you that North Carolina's
hopes are high, her hearts are right and that she presses onward
and upward with eyes fastened on the bright star of our organiza-
tion.
Respectfully submitted,
HANNAH A. LONG,
(Mrs. J. Dolph)
President North Carolina Division, U. D. C.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 303
OHIO DIVISION
Madam President-General and Fellow Members of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy:
It is indeed an honor and a privilege to bring to you the greet-
ings of the Ohio Division. I am proud to present the following re-
port.
The Division is fully registered with a membership of two hun-
dred and fifty-one (251) members, a small gain over last year.
With this small membership $1,409.03 has been donated to the
following United Daughters of the Confederacy activities.
Nearly half of this amount has gone for Confederate Relief,
$623.21.
Education takes second place, $462.00 having been subscribed.
$157.00 of this amount was given to the Woodrow "Wilson Scholar-
ship Fund. Two Chapters have scholarships in the Martha Berry
School and one in Onieda Institute, Ky.
The Stonewall Jackson Chapter of Cincinnati raised $111.00 for
the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.
For the Jefferson Davis Highway $49.00
For the "Women of the South in Wartime" 41.00
For the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund 33.50
For the Maury Monument 51.32
For the Children's Founders Roll of Stone Mountain 44.00
For the Camp Chase Memorial at Columbus 27.00
For a Floral Wreath for Johnston Island Cemetery 8.00
I regret to report the loss of one Chapter in the Division. The
Southern States Chapter of Columbus has disbanded, owing to the
removal of several members to other States including the President
of the Chapter.
With the loss of an adult Chapter, I am proud to report the gain
of a Children's Chapter. The Robert E. Lee Juniors, an offspring
of the Robert E. Lee Chapter of Columbus.
Four Crosses of Service have been bestowed during the year.
The Division has been sorely bereaved this year, having lost by
death five of its most faithful members.
The Saturday after the third of June is always observed by
the Columbus Chapters as Memorial Day at Camp Cemetery. I
wish to thank the many Chapters in the South who so generously
remember the "Boys in Gray" who sleep in Northern soil, by send-
ing flowers and contributions. A wreath is also sent by the Cleve-
land Chapter to Johnson Island Cemetery to honor the dead buried
there.
For several years the Ohio Division has supported an old lady
in Franklin, Ohio, Mrs. Mary McNeil, who is 87 years young. This
is our main Confederate Relief work. Once in a while we have an
appeal from a Veteran in distress, but such cases are rare. The

Home at Pee Wee Valley, Ky., and the Home for Needy Confeder-
ate Women at Richmond, Va., share alike at Christmas time with
good cheer to make the old folks a bit happier.
The Chapters in the Division report a healthy condition, and
peace and good .will abound.
Ohio is justly proud of having had Mrs. W. H. Estabrook, our
"Miss Willie,'' one of her most beloved daughters, serve the Gen-
eral Organization for the past three years, as Custodian of Cross-
es of Honor, for this honor, we thank you.
With gratitude to our President-General for her help and advice
in all things, at all times I respectfully submit this report.
LENA MAY PORTER,
(Mrs. Albert Sidney)
President Ohio Division-
OKLAHOMA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
Greetings from Oklahoma Daughters!
All over the South our Universities and Colleges are celebrating
sometime this month, "Home-coming-day" or "Home-coming-
week." It seems most fitting that our United Daughters of the
Confederacy home-coming is in the month of November, too, for
we think of this as the "Thank-you" month of the year. One of
the things for which we should be, and are, most thankful, is this
Thirty-second Annual Convention, where we gather together, to
report the past year's work, and gain new inspiration, enthusi-
asm and ideas for the work of the coming year.
Oklahoma Division has no great outstanding achievement to re-
port for the year just past. Our organization is working in per-
fect harmony with the Sons and Veterans. During the last twelve
months it has been our privilege to serve them in many ways.
The reports of the officers and committees at our Seventeenth
Convention, held in Sulphur, Oklahoma, June third, fourth and
fifth, show that our Division is growing more and more interest-
ed in the duties and privileges of the work pertaining to this organ-
ization.
Most diligent have we been this year in our care of, and atten-
tion to our Veterans. Nearly all the Chapters have committees
that meet with the Veterans at their regular meetings, and pro-
vide cars for all who are able to attend. Refreshments are fur-
nished, and every assistance given them to keep their camp-fires
burning. Birthdays and all holidays are especially observed.
One new work we have undertaken is the correcting of records.
Many records in the department of "Old-War Records" at Wash-
ington are very incomplete, and some are inaccurate. We have
found that in the Trans-Mississippi records especially, is this true.


## p. 305 (#309) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 305
As most of our Veterans' records are in this department, we are
obtaining every bit of information we can have verified, and en-
deavoring to have these records corrected and completed. This is
a work of love, but it is also a very "up-hill'' task. We meet many
disappointments, and are often discouraged, but the past year
much material has been gathered, and we have really made some
progress. These facts will also be filed with the Oklahoma Histor-
ical Society, to be kept in our Confederate Room, at Oklahoma
City, in the capital building.
Interest in true History has been stimulated in many ways, by
talks in the libraries during Children's hour, by the presentation of
books to schools and libraries, and by essay contest in the public
schools. One of the most recent subjects was, "General Stand-
Watie, Brigadier-General of the Confederate Army," the only full-
blood Indian who ever attained this honor. Another subject that
created much interest was "The Indian Tribes who Were Sympa-
thetic With The South." Praises were given and the prize essays
will be filed with the Historian.
Oklahoma Division has only organiz ^ one new Chapter, Chil-
dren of thn Confederacy this year, The Dixie Girls of Muskogee.
This is a very live Chapter, with a membership of thirty-one. Our
Division Director is doing fine work, and we are ambitious to en-
roll every Southern child in Oklahoma.
Marking the graves of Cenfederate Veterans in country cemeter-
ies, and in towns where there is no Chapter of United Daughters
of the Confederacy, is another work we hope to complete this
year.
From our Scholarship-Loan-Fund two loans have been made this
year to girls in College, and more will be made soon. One boy
and four girls have been kept in high school. Many books, mag-
azines, pictures, and flags have been given to schools. Several
Chapters have arranged special programs for Oklahoma day, No-
vember sixteenth, to be given in the high schools, stressing the
Confederate influence in the making of our State.
AH dues and pledges have been paid, and money has been sent
to many calls out of the State for flowers, school funds and other
requests.
Twenty-six Crosses of Service have been given, and many more
will be given this month. Forty-three Crosses of Honor have been
bestowed.
Most of our Chapters have endeavored to have every Veteran's
name on the Children's Founder Roll, at Stone Mountain, but just
now we are holding this up for a while.
One hundred-forty-four membership certificates have been given
new members this year, and seventy-three children have received
certificates.
Oklahoma Daughters wish to thank the President-General for
her many courtesies, and all the general officers for their respon-
sive interest in our Division.

306 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
We have present in this Convention 13 delegates. This far out-
numbers any previous Oklahoma delegation, which is proof of the
keep interest, loyalty, and co-operation of which I told you last
year.
Respectfully submitted,

(Mrs. R. M. Jones)
President Oklahoma Division.
PHILADELPHIA CHAPTER
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
The Philadelphia Chapter sends you loving greetings!
After a year of activity, we come with every pledge and obliga-
tion fully met.
Officers and members of committees have faithfully performed
their various duties, thereby securing for us meetings full of in-
terest.
The Educational Committee has continued its excellent work.
Besides the three (3) beneficiaries of last year, we have undertak-
en the education of a boy of Southern parentage living in Phila-
delphia. A daughter of one of the members has been awarded the
scholarship at Springdale, Chestnut Hill. This scholarship was se-
cured by the Philadelphia Chapter for use by the General Organi-
zation—total for education, $700.00.
The Benevolence Committee, whose work is our joy and pride,
has to report:
350 new garments distributed through co-operation with
the Needle Work Guild.
3 barrels and 5 boxes of clothing, shoes, etc., sent
to the mountain work in North Carolina; also
clothing and money to a needy boy in Shyland,
North Carolina.
At Thanksgiving and Christmas, numerous baskets
of provisions, donations of money and coal.
The payment of rent and furnishing milk to a fam-
ily, which has for many years depended on our
help; and the supplying of new garments to a fam-
ily of seven (7) in Virginia, whose home has been
destroyed by fire.
Also a large box of clothing sent to Veteran in Vir-
ginia and the sum of $25.00 given to the widow of
a Veteran, who had lived in Philadelphia, to help
. defray his burial expenses.
The value of articles given was $619.12, of cash expended $308.05
—a total of $927.26.


## p. 307 (#311) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 307
From the Chapter Treasurer, augmented by individual contribu-
tions, there has been paid to Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief
Fund, the sum of $280.00.
To the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship Fund (to endow a chair
of Law and Jurisprudence at the University of Virginia), $130.00
was contributed.
To a History Endowment Fund, to be used in Northern Univer-
sities, the sum of $10.00.
To the Solid South Room in Richmond $5.00.
A contribution of $5.00 was made to the Confederate Memorial
Park at Higginsville, Missouri.
Total amount expended on education and benevolence $2,157.26.
As the Jefferson Davis Highway does not pass through Pennsyl-
vanie, $14.00—the amount requested by the Committee from such
States—was paid.
The quota of our Book, "Women of the South in War Times," al-
loted to us, has all been taken.
The Director for the "Conference Veteran" has been untiring
in her efforts to put a copy in every household of the Chapter and
has so far succeeded that we now have 87 subscribers.
The Children of the Confederacy have added 8 to their roll,
making a total of 68 members.
In December, a concert, arranged by members of the Chapter,
and a treat of ice-cream and cake, were given to an enthusiastic
audience of 300 patients at the Philadelphia General Hospital.
Among the nearly 3,000 patients in this City Institution are always
many from Southern States.
On January 19th, the annual luncheon to celebrate the birth of
General Lee was held. We were honored by having the Past Pres-
ident-General, Mrs. Livingston Rowe Schuyler, speak to us. We
also had the great happiness to have with us a number of Veterans
of the World War and to present to them and to the representa-
tives of those Who were unavoidably absent 11 Crosses of Service
—an event which will be long remembered by those present. 17
additional Crosses are to be presented. The collection of the data
for these Crosses by the Director has been a labor of love devot-
edly performed.
Appropriate Memorial Services were held at the National Ceme-
tery at Pittville and also at Finn's Point, N. J., where 2,436 Con-
federate dead are buried. A handsome monument has been erect-
ed to them at this place by the Government. Discovering that this
monument had not been dedicated, members of the Philadelphia
ChaDter. accompanied by Government officials, on October 17th,
held a dedicatory service.
On March 11th we were saddened by the death of our greatly
esteemed Veteran and Honorary Member of the Chapter, Capt.
Robert Mayo.

PITTSBURGH CHAPTER
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
Pittsburgh Chapter has sent me for the third time to extend
greetings and good wishes. I am so glad to be here and will tell
you in as few words as possible of our year's work.
We are told by our President-General that SERVICE is what
counts most in our lives. Our Chapter has had a good year, hav-
ing been able to add much to the comforts of others. The month-
ly meetings are well attended. After the business is over, we have
"A Get-Together-Hour" which is delightful. We have added sev-
eral new members to our list and I must tell you, one is real LIVE
Confederate Veteran—Mr; John F. Green, Company B, Maryland
Guards, 21st Virginia Regiment, Jackson's Division, 86 years old,
in active business, never misses a meeting, FIRST to come, LAST
to leave.
We had last November a Dixie Dance; January 19th a luncheon,
to celebrate and pay honor to Robert E. Lee's birthday; March a
card party to raise money for educational purposes. Our most en-
joyable function socially, was the Luncheon on June 3rd, in honor
of Jefferson Davis, and this is the reason: We had as our guest,
Mrs. Walter Grace, Georgia's Division President, who, by her
charming personality, won the hearts of the entire Chapter. She
told us in the most interesting manner, of some of the wonderful
things this grand organization accomplishes, may she come often
and stay long.
We pledged and have paid the following amounts: Mrs. Norman
V. Randolph Relief Fund $15.00; Jefferson Davis Highway $14.00;
For . ustaining membership in Confederate Museum, Richmond, Va.,
$10.00; Milk and Ice Fund, Pittsburgh, Pa., $10.00; Two Scholar-
ships, and an additional $50.00 for Educational work; Ten subscrip-
tions to Confederate Veteran; Ten copies of Women of the South
in War Times; Many visits to the sick, and flowers sent to cheer
them.
On Memorial Day it is our great privilege to place on the graves
of two Confederate Veterans, wreaths, to show our love and re-
spect and although their last resting place is far from their dear
Southland, "We don't forget."

Memorial Fund, am glad to tell you we will be able to send you a
check in full January 1st.
Well, here we are in Hot Springs, Ark., and if Mrs. Massey keeps
her promise—"Fountain of Youth and Diamonds," we will all go

RHODE ISLAND
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy:
It is with great pleasure I send a report of the Rhode Island
Chapter.
We are few in number and hence our activities are limited. We
have so many requests it has been difficult to know to which
ones to respond. But we have made small donations to the fol-
lowing: The Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund, The Woodrow
Wilson Scholarship Fund and a Christmas Contribution to the
Soldiers Home in Atlanta, Georgia.
There is no Division in Rhode Island, only one Chapter, consist-
ing of fifteen members with the prospects of several new ones
for the ensuing year. We wish to, correct the error in last year's
report recording our membership as twenty-one in number.
For the past two years we have been indebted to Mrs. Chesley
of Boston for representing us at the Convention and carrying our
greetings to you.
Respectfully submitted,
ISOBEL S. RICHMOND,
Pres. of the Rhode Island Chapter.
SOUTH CAROLINA DIVISION
South Carolina Division, Madam President and Daughters:
From the Palmetto State come loving greetings, to the United
Daughters of the Confederacy in Convention assembled.
I am honored to bear the good news to you that the South Caro-
lina Division has had a year of remarkable growth and achieve-
ments. "Forward'' has been our watchword. The increase in mem-
bership has been such that Madam Registrar-General wrote to the
Division-President the following, "South Carolina sends in such
enormous packages of applications that I have a fainty feeling
every time I see one in the mail box."

310 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Nine new Chapters have been organized since last Convention.
The Elloree Chapter of 118 charter members, organized in January,
is the largest Chapter ever organized in the General organization.
Other new Chapters are: "Albert Addison Myers" at Pamplice;
"Summerland College" at Batesburg-Leesville; "Edisto Rifles" at
Bowman; "McCall" at McCall; "William Rowlinski" at Salters;
"Olivia Poozer" at Cameron; "Henry Timrod" at Holley Hill;
"W. B. Acker" at Donalds. The John McKellar Reynolds Chapter
of Greenwood increased their membership 142 this year.
The Children of the Confederacy have seen fine increase in 354
new members and nine new Chapters.
Several Camps Sons of the Confederate Veterans have been or-
ganized under the direction of the United Daughters of the Con-
federacy. Our slogan as concerns this coming generation of Con-
federate descendants is, "A Chapter C. of C. and a Camp S. C. V.
for every Chapter U. D. C." This seems like "hitching our wagon
to a star," but South Carolina United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy believe they can drive the wagon and do their part in making
our organization perpetual. A committee composed of two United
Daughters of the Confederacy and two S. C. V. work in co-opera-
tion in creating sentiment and organizating camps Sons of Con-
federate Veterans.
The care of the Confederate Veterans, their wives and their
widows, has been our paramount work. Material aid and the at-
tentions which brighten.their old age, such as flowers, fruits, let-
ters of cheer, reading matter, automobile drives, picnics and so
forth, have been given. Several Chapters own rolling chairs,
which are used by sick and disabled Veterans.
South Carolina fe^ls very proud of the Confederate Home main-
tained by State appropriation. This institution is a large field for
service. The Board of Commissioners numbers nine persons,
four of whom are United Daughters of the Confederacy with the
Division-President as Chairman. The United Daughters of the
Confederacy Chapters located near the Home arrange programs
of entertainment for the Home and the best of talent is heard by
the old folk. We delight to report that during this administration
the Women of the Sixties have been admitted to the Home through
act of the recent legislature, this being a direct result of the ef-
forts of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
We have more than met our pledge for the Mrs. Norman V. Ran-
dolph Fund, which was $225.00
Tentative to the cause of the Veterans is gleaning their true his-
tory. The great report is too full to itemize, but we quote a few
items: number of historical meetings held 1614; number of pupils
addressed 12,515; addresses made by Confederate Veterans under
auspices of United Daughters of the Confederacy 54 (fifty-four);
number of pamphlets published 1902; special effort continues to
be made to place proper text-books in our schools. The histori-
cal matter is classified and indexed each year and placed in book-
cases in the Relic room in our Capital City. Students and the pub-
lic have full access to same.
We realize that Education is our most constructive work. New
scholarships have been instituted and boys and girls who otherwise

could not have continued their courses have been largely assisted.
$7825 is the amount invested this year in scholarships. Historical
work and educational work are closely allied in that each has ben-
efit from the investments of the other in schools, in essay work,
pictures, prizes, books, flags, addresses and Red Letter Day ob-
servances. We cooperated with the Illiteracy Commission in
searching for students for opportunity schools during the summer.
The quota for our official book has been met and others sold.
Gratifying interest has been manifested in collection of books for
foreign libraries.
Marking of the Jefferson Davis Highway has been completed.
On the division line between North and South Carolina stands a
boulder placed by cooperation of the two Divisions. Handsome
boulders stand at Camden, Cheraw, Columbia, and Aiken. The
smaller markers were bought at a cost of $300.00 and were placed
by the Highway Commission free of charge.
The boulder at Aiken was unveiled in January by four charter
members of the Chapter who are Girls of the Sixties. The Divi-
sion President talked of the work of our organization to an audi-
ence, several of whom were "Yankees" as Aiken is a winter resort.
Gratifying were congratulations from these "Yankees" on our
achievements, and of their new conceptions of our ideals. Abbe-
ville Chapter will soon erect a monument on "Secession Hill."
Chapters continue the work of placing iron crosses on the graves
of Confederate Veterans. The largest part of the state' is completed
in the sections where United Daughters of the Confederacy Chap-
ters exist and new Chapters invariably take this feature of our
work as one of their first endeavors.
There are fewer calls for Crosses of Honor, conclusively most
of the Veterans are supplied.
Three hundred and eighty-nine (389) Crosses of Service to World
War Veterans were issued by the Division chairman, and many are
applying constantly, visualizing the importance of linking Confed-
erate history with the glorious present.
A new work of this year was the Woodrow Wilson Memorial and
South Carolina met her pledge of $600.00.
Realizing the heavy work of Division President, and in appre-
ciation of same, the Division voted to institute the custom of giv-
ing to Ex-Presidents a service pin. These will be presented at Di-
vision Convention to all those living who have served our Divi-
sion, which will be twelve in number at a cost of about $30.00
each.
On the day after our Division Convention at Charleston the Se-
cessionville Chapter of James Island, unveiled a handsome mon|-
ument on the Secessionville battle ground, with a pleasing program
and military tactics, after which an oyster roast was served to the
delegates near the edge of the Atlantic waters.
The St. George Chapter will soon see the completion of their
Memorial Arch.

Other work not classified under special United Daughters of
the Confederacy objectives is local charity work, fitting Hospi-
tal rooms, care of cemeteries, aid to Red Cross and Salvation Army,
tuberculosis camps.
The Division is divided into four districts, each of which is pre-
sided over by a director, who calls her conference in April. These
conferences dispense much business which would otherwise be
handled by the Division Convention, and systematizing in this
manner facilitates the mechanism of our Division.
. During the War Between the States a Confederate vessel was
-sunk in the Pee Dee River. Owing to extreme drought there was
little water in the river and the vessel came to light after more
than sixty years in a water grave. The two Florence Chapters
have obtained permission from the Governor of South Carolina to
reclaim the vessel for historical purposes.
Confederate Veterans Day at our State Fair. Everything free
to them and entertained at dinner by being given a fine turkey
dinner. Railroad fare all over State of South Carolina free.
The work of our Division has been given publicity in the Sun-
day editions of four newspapers and in the Confederate Veteran.
It is impossible to name each activity, but summing the whole
the work of the South Carolina Division is one of love, enthusi-
asm, harmony and cooperation and we are pleased to be a factor
in "carrying on" the noble purposes of our General Organization.
In submitting this, my last report, I thank each one who has en-
couraged my efforts to pilot the South Carolina Division. A glorious
privilege has been mine in serving you.
Respectfully submitted,
ETHEL PAYNE BLACK,
(Mrs. O. D.)
TENNESSEE DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
It is a newly elected president who brings to you the greetings
of the Tennessee Division and a report, in large measure, that of
her able predecessor. The fact that our Division year ends in May
makes it difficult to give a report of the Division for the General
Convention year. The Division Convention was held in Cleve-
land, Tenn., and it is notable that the whole town, although there
are many Northern residents, 'united in entertaining the Daughters.
Our By-laws require the committees to be announced within
thirty days after the close of the Convention. The new commit-
tees were made up as far as possible of delegates attending the
Division Convention; in placing chairmanships the endeavor was
to equalize honors and opportunities for service. The Commit-
tees on Highways, Historical Places and Organization were in-
creased by the addition of a member from each of the ten congres-

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 313
sional districts. The District members are to be chairmen of com-
mittees composed of one from each county in the Districts. Our
goal is one Chapter, at least, in every county. Miss Libbie Morrow,
Nashville, is chairman of Press Representatives, and our notices
are sent to every town having Associated Press service.
Chapter reports show a constantly enlarging membership. Three
Chapters were organized during the past year, and 143 members
were gained by the Children of the Confederacy. Mrs. C. M. Rob-
erts, retiring Director, organized three new Chapters, and the
new Director, Miss Harriett Echols, Sewanee, is enthusiastically
working for the immediate formation of several new Chapters.
The Confederate Veteran is the first thought of the Daughters,
whose ministries embrace their own communities and extend to
the Confederate Home, located eleven miles from Nashville on the
historic Hermitage Plantation, Andrew Jackson's home.
The Confederate Home chairman is always selected from the
Nashville Chapters in rotation and the committee is composed of
a representative from each local Chapter, with a member from
each of the three sections of the State. Committees from each of
the local Chapters look after the entertainment, funerals, and
pleasures of the Veterans in monthly rotation. The State provides
adequately for the running expenses of the Home, and, since this
responsibility has been taken from the Daughters, they have em-
ployed a Chaplain, who has brought much into the lives of the old
soldiers.
We are in full sympathy with the enlargement of the Mrs. Nor-
man V. Randolph Relief Fund for Needy Confederate Women. Our
last Convention adopted a recommendation asking the State to
provide at the Home for Needy Confederate Women of Tennessee.
The Division Historian reports that Chapters have held histor-
ical meetings, presented flags and books to schools and libraries,
observed all Memorial Days, and given prizes to .pupils for essays
inl high schools. The Dyersburg Chapter is writing the Confeder-
ate history of its county.
The Committee on Southern Literature and the Endorsement of
Textbooks succeeded in preventing the adoption by the State of
Gordy's Histories, and in having retained in the schools Waddy
Thompson's Histories.
The Confederate Veteran goes regularly to many libraries, and
the Director for subscriptions is endeavoring to place this very
valuable periodical in every home in Tennessee.
Our Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship pledge of $100.00
has been paid. The Educational committee reports three endow-
ed scholarships in our State University at Knoxville, eleven Di-
vision scholarships and fifteen Chapter scholarships, a total value
of over $3,000.00. The outstanding work of the Division, however,
is the building of Confederate Memorial Hall at Peabody College
for Teachers, Nashville. The faithful Chairman of this work, Mrs.
Owen Walker, Franklin, reports that only about $6,000.00 remains
unpledged. It is the hoDe to begin very soon the construction of
this Memorial, which Will speak to thousands of pupils and visi-
tors continuously of the valor and sacrifices of the men who died

and the women who worked for a Cause which will grow more
and in esteem as the years pass by. This Home will give the wor-
thy descendants of worthy forbears a rent free home while fit-
ting themselves for their life work.
The importance of having such a building, which fills the double
purpose of a monument, and a living memorial, cannot be over es-
timated. Not only do teachers for the whole South receive their
training here, but many from the Northern and Western States are
also in attendance. When the fund of $50,000 has been complet-
ed, the Peabody Trustees will give to the United Daughters of the
Confederacy the Chair of Southern History so long desired. As
practically all teachers now receive their training in Teachers
Colleges, the value of such a Chair of History cannot be estimat-
ed. |-;
The Ft. Donelson Monument is a State work, the fund for which
is steadily growing.
The Division was represented by the VicehPresident for Middle
Tennessee at a meeting held at the birthplace of Sam Davis, Smyr-
na, Tenn.—the boy hero than whom history records no nobler—
to initiate a movement to have the State purchase this property as
a State Shrine.
A valuable and interesting report has been made by Mrs. M. L.
Vesey, Chairman of Marking Historic Tennessee, which shows what
has already been accomplished. It is our purpose to place a mark-
er on every spot where a skirmish or battle was fought, and the
Chairman of Highways, Mrs. Embry Anderson, hopes to have
planted along the Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Dixie High-
ways, a memorial tree for every Tennessee Confederate Veteran.
Already many trees, vines and flowers have been planted, particu-
larly along the Lee Highway. The November American Motor
Magazine featured all of Tennessee's scenic highways.
Most of the Tennessee Veterans have already received their
Crosses of Honor, and we aref now bestowing the Crosses of Ser-
vice. Many more bestowals would have been reported by the Di-
rector had the Chapters been able to secure the necessary applica-
tion blanks in time.
The Division Director, Mrs. Eugene Monday, Knoxville, has plac-
ed 157 volumes of "Women of the South in War Times" during the
year.
A binding committee is working to bring up accurately to date
all unbound records of the Division, so that they may be placed
in our archives. A hall has been set apart for Confederate relics
in our beautiful War Memorial Building, which was dedicated in
September. A committtee from the Veterans organization, the Sons
of Veterans and the Daughters of the Confederacy will pass on
what will be of most value and interest, and see that the furnish-
ing and arrangement is suitable and attractive.
Tennessee is very fortunate in having a Daughter, Mrs. Fannie E.
Selph, who is now preparing and giving as lectures, studies which
she calls "Building a Great Nation." Her address at the Middle
Tennessee District Conference was the most valuable feature of
that very pleasant and helpful conference held in Dickson, Tenn.,

under the direction of the Division's Second Vice-President, Mrs.
W. M. Harrison, who also secured and supervised a Rest Room at
the State Fair for all Daughters and those interested in the Con-
federacy.
At the State reunion of the Veterans held in Humboldt, with the
local Chapter, of which Mrs. A. R. Dodson is president, as host-
ess, the Division was represented by the retiring President and the
Vice-President for West Tennessee.
The Division has been bereaved in the death of Mrs. William
Hume, Honorary President of Tennessee Division, Chaplain of
Tennessee Division, and Honorary President of the General Organs
ization. Mrs. Nathaniel Gooch, also a charter member of the Unit-
ed Daughters of the Confederacy and an active worker in the
Mother Chapter, has been appointed to succeed her as Chaplain.
The Daughters have entered enthusiastically into the sale of the
Stone Mountain. Memorial Coin. More than their quota was sold
in the Summer Campaign, and plans for the Harvest Campaign are
being made. Tennessee regards this monument as the greatest op-
portunity the South has ever had to write its story in enduring
form, and the Tennessee children, from its inception, have been
building their Honor Rolls.
The Tennessee Chairman of Navy Day recognized the patriotism
of our organization by asking the President to serve on his Ad-
visory Committee. As a representative of the Organization in Ten-
nessee, she was the guest of the Sons of the American Revolution
when the Tennessee Society entertained the Executive Board of
the National organization, and, because of her office, was intro-
duced to the State Convention Parent-Teachers Association.
With a deep appreciation of the magnitude of the work of our
general organization, and with the purpose to co-operate as fully
as possible in all its plans, this report is
Respectfully submitted,
MARY LOU GORDON WHITE,
President Tennessee Division.
TEXAS DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
It is indeed at most appreciated honor at the hands of my Divi-
sion to bring you greetings and tidings from the "Lone Star'' State,
Texas, and 'tis hardly worth while to tell how ardous the task,
that this first message of mine, might be fraught with much that
is of interest, by way of progress, profit and pleasure.
In October our annual Convention was held in Marshall, a thrivr
ing East Texas town where we had one of the most harmonious
and profitable meetings, and Marshall was lauded for her wonder-
ful hospitality and entertainment.

316 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
Texas has been favored with two visits from our President-Gen-
eral, Mrs. Harrold—at our Convention held in Houston in 1924,
and the Dallas General Reunion of the Confederate Veterans held
in May.
Confederate Veterans
First, benevolence and consideration for Confederate Veterans,
will give a few details of Texas work for them: Our 89 Chapters
are doing much for the pleasure and comfort of Texas Veterans,
by way of courtesies, cash donations, and transportation to re-
unions, besides contributing yearly to the Norman V. Randolph
Relief Fund for Widows. We aid both with pensions, etc.
Texas has two Homes containing some 500 inmates. While these
Homes are maintained by the State, there is much we do for their
comfort and pleasure. A Radio, boxes of goodies for Thanksgiving
and Christmas, and furnish the men with identification buttons
that will pass them free anywhere, and of which they are very
proud. At last Convention the motion carried for each Chapter to
send amount in proportion to membership to furnish them another
Christmas, long to be remembered, also to send them cards for
they are truly pathetic in their loneliness and age and look to us
for sunshine and cheer.
Our State Museum located at the same place, Austin, where the
homes are, is greatly improved with new shelving and cases being
beautifully kept up by the Division, and members of Albert Sid-
ney Johnston Chapter, to admit the public.
Museum Richmond
Texas has just donated to Texas Room in Richmond, Va., a most
artistic, hand carved Educational Honor Roll, and truly a work of
art.
World War Records
Next in importance to our Veterans is the duty to their sons—
Veterans of the World War—and the only way we can connect
the two generations of heroism is by our "Cross of Service." So
World War Records and the bestowing of the Cross has had a
good start in Texas. We have awarded more this year than all put
together heretofore, and thought to win the prize with 150 Cross-
es awarded. Texas awarded 115 with 35 applications pending.
The Confederate Veteran Publication
Nearly every Chapter in the State subscribes for the Veteran
for its own use, and our committee handles many more subscrip-
tions.
Chapter Extension
Texas gives four (4) new Chapters this year, and the adult mem-
bership totals now 89 with around 8519 members and 200 increase
for C. of C.
The Angel of Death has not spared Texas this year and in Jan-
uary our Cornelia Branch Stone, whom we all claim was called
higher.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 317
The first official act of our woman governor, Mrs. Ferguson, was
to place the flag at half mast on the capitol, in honor of Mrs. Stone,
and at the solicitation of Texas Division Executive Board then in
session at Austin. Gen. Cochran, of our Veterans passed away on
January 1st, 1925, and Mrs. Mary E. Bryan who was a Second Vice-
President-General at one time.
Memorial
Many Chapters are still building monuments and erecting drink-
ing fountains and "Log Cabins." Falls county has a log cabin,
and Waco a double log cabin, and the lady of the "log cabin" at
Waco wrote me that she kept open .house at the Cotton Palace Ex-
position, for which Waco is noted, and it would be surprising of
what an educational value it is—these log cabin museums, and
how ignorant the general public appears, some seeming to know
nothing of the period of the "War Between the States" and the
lady of the "Log Cabin" considered her two weeks teaching his-
tory by this process, equal to a year in the usual way, and she has
taught all of her life.
Stone Mountain
Now that a sculptor has been secured for the completion of
Stone Mountain, Children's Chapters are putting forth strenuous
efforts to secure names for the Children's Founders Roll, and sell-
ing coin and otherwise contributing.
Memorial
Waxahachie placed 275 markers on graves of Confederate dead.
Ennis marked the graves of 200 Veterans, donated 10 volumes of
Southern Literature to schools and is' planning for a monument.
Marlin Chapter has erected a drinking fountain at a cost of one
thousand dollars, and gave two gold and silver medals for histori-
cal work in school.
Corsicana has placed flags in school and donated 75 books to
school libraries.
Abilene placed 50 volumes in school libraries.
Belton is the banner Chapter tho'—their first Historical program
being put on by five, girls from the C. of C. of the mother Chapter.
Belton registered 34 young women under the age of 30 years for
United Daughters of the Confederacy service.
Bonnie Blue Flag Chapter organized "Lone Star Girls" Chapter
of 27 members, and donated several busts of Jefferson Davis to
schools. All Chapters, in fact, the entire State protested a bust
of Abraham Lincoln being placed in our new Technological Col-
lege for Texas.
Dallas Chapter No. 6, offering prize of $10.00 gold piece to high
school students for best essay on Jefferson Davis and placed his
bust in High School, also donated more than life size statue of Gen.
Lee to Confederate Home.

lutions at our annual Convention in 1924, which was adopted:

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 319
"That Texas take up the work"—not thinking to go over any ones
head in the mother organization but ever zealous for our beloved
work, and judging now a good time to do so while President Coo-
lidge "thinks it time the United States was paying her debts."
Jefferson Davis Highway
Considering the unsettled condition of State Highway Laws, we
are progressing perceptibly, placing markers, having gone through
37 counties and completed in the State Highway 7 per cent sys-
tem. Our State is so large it takes a long time to get across.
Social
President of Texas Division has enjoyed much socially over the
State and attended the dedication of two monuments at Mansfield,
La., that of Generals Dick Taylor and de Polignac.
June 3rd, visited San Antonio Chapters where 42 "Crosses of Ser-
vice" were bestowed.
Met with Ross' Ector's and Granbury's Brigrade in their 50th
and last reunion.
After the Dallas General Reunion of Confederate Veterans, on
Saturday, was entertained jointly with our President-General at
the home of Gen. K. M. VanZandt in Fort Worth, with lawn party.
Gave Memorial address in Henderson; was Matron of Honor
again at Abilene State reunion.
And have visited much in the interest of organization and World
War Records, and awarding the Cross of Service.
Now friends and co-workers, let's again rejoice in the price-
less heritage that is ours, and continue to call ourselves "United
Daughters of the Confederacy," and Texas Division President feels
honored, and is grateful to have completed her first year's work
as President of Texas Division.
Respectfully submitted,
NOLA COBB BIVENS,
(Mrs. J. K.)
President of Texas Division.
VIRGINIA DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
As the new Division-President, I bring to you the cordial greet-
ings of the Virginia Chapters.
Just five weeks have passed since the close of our Division Con-
vention at Roanoke. We had a most successful and inspiring meet-
ing, and it is with pleasure that I bring you a summary of the
year's work reported at that time.


## p. 320 (#324) ############################################

320 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
We feel that the Division has done good work during the past
months and that much has been accomplished. We are grateful to
our retiring President, who, by her unfailing energy and splendid
executive ability made such an efficient leader.
There were 680 new members gained during the year and four
new Chapters were formed, and there is the prospect of several
others being formed very soon.
Almost immediately after the close of the Savannah Convention
we began the work of raising the amount of our pledge to the
Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship. It is with the keenest
pleasure that I can report $1146.55 raised for that fund. A later
report to this fund raises to total to $1908.05.
First of all our activities comes the work of Relief. This Com-
mittee, under the able supervision of Mrs. Randolph, is doing by
far the most important benevolent work of the Division—that of
helping to care for, and to bring cheer to, Confederate Women in
their own homes. This work is named for Mrs. Randolph and is
very dear to the hearts of all Virginia Daughters. This year $1517.00
was contributed to this cause. In addition to the Relief work
done through the Committee, Chapters throughout the State have
expended $15,324.00 in local relief and care of the Veterans in their
midst.
The Chapter at Lexington, by means of their splendid Jackson
Memorial Hospital, did charity work amounting to $1436.80, and
raised $20,500.00 to enlarge their hospital.
Next to the care of Qur aged women and Veterans, comes that
most constructive of all, the work of Education. In helping our
young people to gain better educational advantages, we are now
administering thirty-nine scholarships, a total value of $4256. Of
this number twenty-eight, valued at $3501, are filled for the cur-
rent school year. Many of these scholarships are tuition scholar-
ships, but five are full scholarships maintained by the Division.
This includes one at each of the State Teachers' Colleges, and one
at William and Mary College. By means of a legacy left us by Miss
Mary Curtis Lee, we have recently established at William and
Mary College a scholarship to be known as the Mary Curtis Lee
Loan Fund. Educational work is growing slowly but steadily. The
total activities along this line this year amounted to $8256.00.
Progress is being made with World War records, sixty-six Cross-
es of _ Service having been presented within the past few months,
and fifty additional blanks filled. One Chapter presented a Cross
of Honor to a Veteran and a Cross of Service to his son upon the
same occasion.
In the Sanatorium at Catawaba two cots are maintained for
tubercular Veterans, wives, widows, and descendants of Veterans—
a work which is doing great good.
Ever mindful of the importance of the perpetuation of true Con-
federate history, we are justly proud of the work done along his-
torical lines. In briefly summing up this work I would call at-
tention to the fact that 8410 essays were written on subjects per-
taining to the Confederacy; 2345 books given to schools and col-
leges; 1204 prizes and medals given for historical work; 2454 talks


## p. 321 (#325) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 321
made in schools, and 125 reviews of histories made. Historical
markers amounting to $463, have been placed.
Following up this excellent work, the Committee on History and
Literature has written many hundreds of letters and attended meet-
ings of the American Historical Society, in an official capacity.
Our chairman for Women of the South in War Times has worked
diligently in placing the books before the people, and Chapters
have responded fairly well.
Some years.ago when Virginia Division undertook the responsi-
bility of maintaining a custodian at Lee Chapel, in Lexington, we
little dreamed of the wonderful opportunity to be gained through
this means of disseminating Confederate history. During the past
year 24,812 persons registered at the Chapel, and on July 4, alone,
450 persons came to pay solemn tribute to our beloved dead.
Among those registering at the Chapel within the last few months
it is interesting to note the name of Maj. Sir Frederick Maurice,
who wrote the life of Gen. Lee. Here, in the little pulpit, just in
front of the recumbent statue, Gen. Maurice spoke most feelingly
of the life and service of Gen. Lee. The register shows also, fifty
teachers from University Summer School; 136 editors, representing
38 states; the men composing an orchestra from Chicago; several
troops of Boy Scouts; 400 Veterans from, the State Reunion; and
200 Legionnaires. Representatives from fourteen foreign countries
were among those who came, and to all of these has gone some
word of Confederate history.
As we must needs look to those who come after us to carry on
the work so dear to our hearts, we are stressing the importance of
the Children of the Confederacy. Five new Chapters have been
formed this year, and 287 new members registered, making a total
of 776 Cbjldren registered. Several years ago, the Crater Memo-
rial Road around the battlefield of the Crater at Petersburg, was
planned. The Government has appointed a Commission consisting
of one Confederate Veteran, one Federal Veteran and a Govern-
ment engineer to survey the road and plan for the proposed devel-
opment. Recently discovered tunnels, belonging to both Confeder-
ate and Federal armies, are of great interest, and are directly upon
this road. The Children of the Confederacy are to have the Forts
and breastworks in perpetual care.
Reports of Confederate Museum, Jefferson Davis Highway, and
other Committees will be given by their Chairmen.
Six District meetings were held in April and May, all of which
were intensely interesting and instructive. We had the pleasure of
having our President with us at five of these meetings.
The total amount of Virginia Division Activities for the year is
$59,270.35.

322 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
WASHINGTON DIVISION
Madam President-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy in Convention Assembled:
It is my pleasure to place before you today, my report of the
year's work accomplished by the Division of the Evergreen State,
Washington.
We are happy that our Division President has made it possible
to represent us personally, and through her contact with the Con-
vention, we look for new inspiration.
From the three Chapters, splendid reports were read at the
annual Division Convention which was held in Tacoma, October
14th, having as its setting the beautiful new Hotel Winthrop, and
Dixie Chapter as hostess.
From Robert E. Lee Chapter of Seattle, (our largest Chapter)
comes the report of splendid social life for both Veterans and
Daughters. Christmas parties and summer picnics with always
a goodly attendance of Veterans and their wives, but quite the most
delightful affair for the Daughters is the Southern Bail held an-
nually in March, and looked forward to by many of Seattle's so-
cial leaders.
The serious side of the Organization is not forgotten for they
have contributed generously to many causes.
Camp Chase .$ 1.00
Confederate Veteran for Public Library ".. 1.50
Monument Fund (Seattle) 190.00
Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Fund for Needy Women 2.00
Subscription to Women of the South in War Times (com-
pletes Division quota) 16.00
Their monument to the Confederate dead to be placed in their
plot in one of Seattle's cemeteries, it is hoped will be completed
this year.
Dixie Chapter, Tacoma, looks to the happiness of their Veterans
especially at Christmas time, when they are remembered in some
happy way besides having the "Veteran" sent to each of them
for the year.
For the past several years, the Chapter has been placing markers
on Confederate Veterans graves and this year, have placed six in
Tacoma and vicinity.
Their contributions to various causes:
Maury Monument $ 3.00
Miss Rutherford's Scrap Boolc (Chapter use) 2.50
A Confederate Veteran at Christmas 10.00
Confederate Veteran Magazine in two High Schools and
Public Library 4.50
Monument Fund (Seattle) 25.00
Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholarship 15.00
Jefferson Davis Highway 14.00
Mrs. Norman V. Randolph Relief Fund 3.00

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 323
Of our Mildred Lee Chapter of Spokane, we are justly proud, for
it is she who has done most in historical way. They have pur-
chased book cases and have started a library, placing it in their
local Y. W. C. A. with such books as "The South in the Building
of a Nation," "Worsen of the South in War Times" and many oth-
ers that can be used as reference books and will be a great help to
High School students as well as delightful reading for any one, as
such books are not found in the libraries of the Northwest unless
placed there by some generous Southerner or by the United Daugh-
ters of the Confederacy.
Mildred Lee contributed $2.00 to the Mrs. Norman V. Randolph
Relief Fund, and $10.00 to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Scholar-
ship.
Death has laid its heavy hands upon our Division this year and
has taken many members and Veterans, one of whom I make spe-
cial mention, Mrs. Nell E. Southerlin of Spokane, one of our Divi-
sion Presidents, who was known personally by many of you, hav-
ing attended several General Conventions as Washington's special
representative. Her place in our organization can not easily be
filled.
With best wishes for the success of this thirty-second annual
Convention, this report is
Respectfully submitted,
MARTHA HOSKINS SCHLUSS,
(Mrs. Kurt)
Retiring President, Washington
Division.
WEST VIRGINIA DIVISION
Madam Presidentl-General and United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy:
It is with pleasure that I again come before the General Con-
vention with the report of the West Virginia Division for the past
year.
The Twenty-Seventh Annual Convention of the West Virginia
Division was held in Clarksburg, celebrated as the birth-place of
that distinguished citizen and soldier, General Stonewall Jackson.
It is near this city that the Division is contemplating the erection
of a memorial to General Jackson on land given the Division by
Dr. S. D. Hays,
Historical evening was particularly appropriate to the place and
most interesting to the Convention. We were all delighted by the
address delivered by Mr. E. G. Smith, entitled, "A Stonewall
Phase.'' It followed a personal line giving many unpublished in-
cidents in the life of "our peerless leader." Being so removed
from the beaten path of General Jackson's biographers, it was not
only interesting but very instructive to those present; and all felt
that they had gained a new and more personal view of the General.

324 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
We have completed the organization .Of two new Chapters; the
Captain E. D. Camden at Sutton, and the Princeton Chapter at
Princeton. Both start in the work with great enthusiasm.
The Division Officers report as follows:
The Historian.—The Historian reports an active and enthusias-
tic interest in practically all the Chapters in our Division in the
work coming under her supervision. All Chapters report month-
ly historical readings, many medals given, many grave markers
placed, celebration of the birthdays of Generals Lee and Jackson
and President Davis with fitting exercises, a proper observance of
Memorial Day. Through the efforts of one of our members copies of
John Brown's Will, with interesting information relative to same,
have been placed in the City Library of Boston, Mass., and the
City and School Libraries of Wilmington, Delaware.
The Registrar.—Our Division Registrar has worked hard to give
us a 100% registration in the State, and though she did not attain
this high goal, we of the West Virginia Division feel that she has
done a Wonderful work, and that registration is progressing in a
Very satisfactory manner. With a little more time we should be able
to report the goal attained. We now have 1911 members in good
standing.
The Treasurer.—In the Division Treasurer's letter, her annual
letter, the Chapters were asked to contribute to twelve causes or
funds—five obligatory and seven non-obligatory, but desired. Sev-
eral Chapters contributed to still other funds, thus making total
funds to which chapter gifts were sent through Division Treasurer
seventeen. When our Treasurer took over the books twelve years
ago, gifts were sent to but three funds, these three being General
and Division per capita taxes and Division Educational Fund. So
you can see how the work has grown and also how the liberality
of the Chapters has increased.
It is a great pleasure for me to report that the West Virginia Di-
vision has gone over the top the second time in the sale of our
book, "Women of the South in War Times," with five copies to
spare.
Our Division is also proud of the fact that during the past year
her Chapters have awarded sixty-seven Crosses of Service to World
War Veterans. This is a very interesting work and is spreading
throughout our Division, being due to the efforts of our most ef-
ficient Director, Mrs. M. A. Snodgrass.
State educational work is progressing along all lines. Robert
E. Lee Chapter at Fairmont has renewed its scholarship in the
Martha Berry School. William Stanley Haymond Chapter main-
tains a scholarship in the Fairmont Teachers' College. Greenbrier
College Scholarship is filled, besides several other scholarships in
other schools.
Many Chapters report subscriptions to "The Confederate Vet-
eran," one Chapter in particular, Bluefield, Mrs. Watkins, Director,
reporting 60 new subscriptions, and 10 renewals.
A goodly number of Chapters have bought Stone Mountain Me-
morial Coins.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 325
We have one Chapter in our Division, Huntington, Number 150,
which is building a Chapter house. We believe this is rather un-
usual, and we are gratified to know we have such a progressive
organization in our Division. This Chapter is also the banner
Chapter in their contribution last year.
I have signed 275 certificates last year, including Children of the
Confederacy certificates.
While we did not attain the goal to which our ambition urged
us, we of our Division feel that we have just completed one of
the most successful year's work which our organization has ex-
perienced. Interest and enthusiasm seem to be increasing along
all lines and the results of loyal work and co-operation are be-
ginning to stand forth.
Respectfully submitted,
(Mrs. William H.)
MINNIE FOLSON THOMAS,
Retiring President West Virginia
Division.

33C THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
IN MEMORIAM
Those members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
who have passed from earthly life to the life everlasting in the
past year.
One of the avowed purposes of our Organization is to embalm in
grateful memory those who by virtue of noble living and high
courage have made the world brighter and better. With this in
mind, we, of the Daughters of the Confederacy, have set aside this
quiet hour, and pause at the very beginning of our busy session
to bear testimony to the worth and faithful services to our As-
sociation of those of our membership who have laid down the
burdens of the flesh since our last Annual Meeting.
There is something in the human heart that prompts those who
go to say to those who are left,
"Remember me."
And so yielding to this human impulse we keep our tryst with
memory now
One by one the pioneer workers in the United Daughters of the
Confederacy are passing away. This year this society is called
upon to mourn the passing of four of its Honorary Presidents:
Mrs. Cornelia Branch Stone of Texas, one of the great women of
the South, one who by her wisdom, moderation, fairmindedness
and brilliant mental endowments, has been an inspiration to a
following generation of southern women; who was also a Past
President-General of this Society and for whom a special tribute
will be paid during these exercises.
Mrs. Electra Semmes Colston, a radiant and outstanding person-
ality in the United Daughters of the Confederacy who accepted
her, Confederate blood as a rich inheritance through the grace of
•God, but who also recognized it as carrying with it an obligation
to be worthy of this nation of ours.
Mrs. William Hume of Tennessee who assumed the various
offices with which she was honored with a lofty impulse to pre-
serve the dignity and true objects of our organization.
And Mrs. Helen Plane of Georgia whose dauntless courage, in-
dominable will and tireless energy brought about so many good
works in the name of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
These noble women, members of the generation who touched
and knew the scarlet years of 61-65 whose records we would hon-
or and preserve, now rest from their labors, but they have left us
as an inspiration the records of their long and useful lives crown-

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 337
ed by partiotic efforts for the United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy and their names shall ever be cherished in loving memory.
May our future membership be the lengthened shadow of these
great women.
And what of the rank and file of our membership, those loyal
and devoted women in small towns, little villages and far away
scattered groups, who have enriched our Society by their faith
and their works, and who have gone up higher since our last an-
nual roll call. Great leaders can do little without faithful and loy-
al co-workers; plans can only be accomplished with the devoted
effort of the many, and it was through the efforts of this vast rank
and file that our pioneers could lead our organization onward to
such growth and prosperity as it is today.
So with bowed heads we stand at this solemn hour and give
ourselves up to the thought of death and all that it means in hu-
man life, and thus we realize how ;great is the strength of this
tie which binds us together in United Daughters of the Confed-
eracy membership, a tie of blood and of a common heritage; for
those who we mourn now had as their supreme interest the wel-
fare of our beloved South; with them duty and service to their
home land always stood first, they inspired and will continue to
inspire, those of us who associated with them an ambition for
servicer. As women, we recall their courage, their sincerity of pur-
pose, their strong convictions, their deep love of right and justice
and their unflinching advocacy of it; spring from the highest type
of citizenship that our race has produced—a citizenship
which stood for a fortitude, heroism and devotion which
it will be the dispair of future generations to achieve, thev
were free from mean and selfish ambitions and out of this self
knowledge came the courage "to do unhesitatingly and, as a matter
of course, the things which they were convinced ought to be done.
And through all of their lives we find the note of strong, simple
religious convictions; this was the basis of their unfailing hope-
fulness and courage. Their faith in God made them strong in
adversity; for when the soul of the Southland seemed dulled and
deadened, the United Daughters of the Confederacy sounded the
call to honor and duty, and they dared to raise their standard and
claim their inheritance in America's histoy and in America's
ideals as the great founders of our country had written them with
their swords and with their pens. The women whose memory we
honor at this hour "fought the good fight and kept the faith;" let
us carry on as they have pointed the way; let us stand together to
uphold our great inheritance and to maintain the splendid en-
deavors and mighty accomplishments which they have secured
for us in the name of this great organization; let us stand, as they
did. for "well-thought-out principle" and clear judgment and not
be guided by mere emotion, let us stand for American ideals and
for the Constitution of the United States as given us by our great
forebearers; and so shall we honor the names and the memories
of those devoted Daughters of the Confederacy.
There is a Halo about grief which lifts it up above material
thoughts and carries the soul of man upward toward a higher
Being for comfort and consolation.

of Ihe dirge like a pean of joy breaking through tears like the
cry of triumph over death, and we are reminded that only those
are fit to live who do not fear to die; and none are fit to die who
have shrunk from the joy of life and the duty of life. But life and
death are parts of the same great adventure, and in their perfect
fitness for this great adventure must we think of those splendid
women who, having lived useful lives, taught that greatness of
lessons in their death, "that the spirit is triumphant over the
flesh and that death is the joyous beginning of the Resurrection.
"Gone are these Daughters, from their native shores which
knew and loved their tread; their barks have pushed a path
through waves and ways unknown. Gone are these Daughters.
How their eager souls forever questing where high virtue gleam-
ed lead us to new conquests; further peaks from which our eyes
beheld still wider views. They gave us visions when our souls
were cold, gave us their own most ardent zeal for truth, for
justice, for our Homeland's name and fame. Gone are these
Daughters!
But let us remember that all of us who give service and stand
ready for sacrifice are the torch bearers. We run with the torch
until we fall, content if we can pass them to the hands of other
runners.
AND NOW—We place on record our sense of the far reaching
value of these lives lived in unrestricted, service for others, and
our sorrow in the loss of their sweet companianship and the in-
spiration that they were to us in our.earthly pilgrimage.
We are grateful to God for the privilege of having been asso-
ciated with such women, some of them beautiful in person, many
of them saintly in thought and all of them generous in heart and
noble in character.
The pines and the palmettoes of this happy properous South
of today sing their requiem and the soft winds from the moun-
tains to the seashore tell the story of their love and their useful
service for the,History of the Confederacy and the welfare of its
veteran men and women and their descendants for many genera-
tions to come. j ,<

A TRIBUTE TO THE CONFEDERATE VETERANS
AND THEIR SONS
(Anne Bachman Hyde)
United Daughters of the Confederacy:
For a long period we,have gathered at this hour to lament the
departure and commemorate the virtues of our beloved Confed-
erate Veterans, and of late years there has crept in a new, sad
note as we record the losses of their sons and grandsons in suc-
ceeding wars.


## p. 339 (#343) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 339
When we recall the heroic struggle of our Confederate soldiers
against overwhelming numbers; when we remember the death of
our bravest and best; when we contemplate the awful sacrifice
of the youth of the South, cut off in the springtime of their age
and none to declare their generation for them, we are inclined
to say: why was all this waste of ointment made!
But we ourselves have lived long enough to know that success
is not always a measure of good, and that from apparent defeat
often come results that make the vanquished victors.
We have seen our Veterans honored in every land and by all
peoples; we have heard the principles for which they fought
proclaimed as the purest and most patriotic thought of the hu-
man mind, for resistance to tyranny has ever been the first im-
pulse of the noble soul.
We know that they cannot be long with us now, for the young-
est who wore the gray has almost reached the time allotted to
man.
They are with us today; there comes a sudden sense of absence,
and we look about us for "the huge oak that grew on the brow
of the hill and sheltered such an extent of ground," and, lo! it has
vanished over night.
For their example and patience we are grateful and very proud
of the heritage of valor they bequeathed to their descendants but
"Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail
Or knock the breast; no weakness nor contempt,
Dispraise or blame; nothing but well and fair
And what may quiet us in a death so noble."
As they stood in their lot in the War between the States, so their
descendants did their part, as their chance lay, helping to fill up
the measure of the cup of suffering as it came to them.
And,
"Lest the young soldiers be strange in Heaven
God bids the old soldiers they all adored
Come to Him and wait for them, clean, new—shriven,
A happy door-keeper in the House of the Lord."
Thus we may leave them, the old guard with the armor laid
down and honors well won, who have passed through the gates
into the city, greeting with pride, free from earthly stain, the
modest young knights, not worn with life's service, nor burden-
ed with the weight of years, but radiant with quick transition, and
having had a glimpse of that Vision we would fain be with them
too.
MEMORIAL MRS. CORNELIA BRANCH STONE
(By Decca Lamar West)
In this sacred hour in which we imeet to pay tribute to those
who have been especially distinguished in our ranks, or some
noble Veteran or son; there is no time for an intimate biography
of their lives and work. I would that there were in this instance,

340 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
for a biography of Mrs. Cornelia Branch Stone, from the years of
her splendid and vigorous middle age, to her still more splendid
old age, (because it was so rarely beautiful) would also be an
epitome of the work of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
from its incipiency to the present time. It is equally true that no
accurate history of the United Daughters of the Confederacy could
be written without revealing much of the life and work of Mrs.
Stone. One could almost say, without fear of jealousy or crit-
icism, "Mrs. Stone was the Texas Division." Yet in the end every
State, delighted to claim her interest and advice and to pay her
homage. A close study of the records of the General Associa-
tion, the Texas Division of the United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy; the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs; the Daughters of
the Republic of Texas; the Texas Women's Press Association; the
Colonial Dames of America; the Daughters of the American Rev-
olution, and numerous other associations and of her Church,
would testify to many movements inaugurated or perfected by
her, which prove a mentality and executive ability unsurpassed
by women of any age, or country.
We could pay her no higher tribute than by studying her work
and emulating her example to the best of our ability. Few can
boast of her brilliant intellect and statesmanship, but all may
strive to follow her example of faithfulness to every obligation.
Individual responsibility, which is the highest civic virtue, she
taught by precept and example.
Her last published letter to the North Carolina friends, who
inaugurated the plan to honor her by establishing the Cornelia
Branch Stone Endowment Scholarship for girls at Randolph-Ma-
con Womans College, shows her sense of appreciation not only for
their loving thought, which met with unanimous response from
every Division, but her far seeing, vision of our greatest work
and obligation. No monument of granite or bronze, however
magnificent its conception, could be so appropriate a memorial
to her as this scholarship, because its practical educational work
had been the keynote of her methods in every organization with
which she was associated.
A great poet speaks of "Death, the King of the World." Does
she not give him too much power? King Death I How we cringe
and fear him, but why, if we have faith? True he reaps with
grim persistence. iWhen it is the innocent babe at its mother's
breast, the prattling child at its play, the maid or youth, the bud-
ding man or woman; aye, the mature, we grieve, we mourn. We
are inconsolable because to our finite minds it is untimely; we
feel that they might have meant so much to life.
When King Death has spared his scythe until a soul has ex-
perienced all the blessings, the sorrows and joys of earthly ex-
istence; has received abundantly and given oppulently to the
world, why should we grieve? The friend whom we commemo-
rate would not have it so. No grief, but joy in the thought that
not only to the usual span of life but far beyond, we had her wis-
dom, her counsel, her love, her prayers. No, we need not cringe
before King Death, but lift our voices and say: "Stand back, King
Death, you are not triumphant; SHE LIVES still to be our inspira-
tion! You, King Death, but held back for a moment the unseen

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 341
barriers that she might enter triumphantly into life eternal, her
light more glorious!"
Yet, we are mortal still and but for j a moment would bring
the gift of our flowers and tears.
The lines of another great poet came to me when I received the
message that as the daughter of one her dearest friends, I was
privileged to pay this tribute of respect of love and veneration.
This greatest "In memoriam" we all have known since childhood,
yet the words ever come back to us with added meaning when
we, for a time, have lost a friend. I, too, sat beside vast waters.
True there wtere no "rocky crags," but a shining silver sea lap-
ping against golden sands, just as it does on the Island home of
our loved friend. The great Laureate's lines seemed to come as
the sound of a deep toned bell, voicing what each of us feels:
"Break, break, break,
On thy cold grey stones O, Sea!
And I would that my,tongue could utter
The thoughts that arise in me.
Oh, well for the fisherman's boy,
As he shouts with his sister at play;
Oh, well for the sailor lad
As he sings in his boat on the bay.
And the stately ships go on
To their haven under the hill,
But oh! for the touch of a vanished hand,
And the sound of a voice, that is still!
Break, break, break,
At the foot of thy crags, O, Sea!
But'the tender grace of a day that is
Can never come back to me."

death should occur before receiving it, the Chapter President hav-
ing given such order shrfl award it to his oldest living descendant
or widow, under the provisions of these rules.
If a Veteran, being seriously ill with evidence that the end is
near and he desires the Cross, it may be given him at once with-

the Custodian-General that no delay may be had in filling order.
Section 4. Chapters having received Crosses ordered should
acknowledge such to the Custodian-General, and should publish
notice of time and place of bestowal, with names of Veterans to

and, if in case of illness or any other obstacle to delivery of a
Cross to a Veteran not present, whose name has been publicly an-
nounced, as a recipient, he can call or send for such Cross; and
after all reasonable methods have been tried to deliver Crosses
to those awarded, all unclaimed crosses ordered, after holding
the same for two months must be returned to the Custodian-Gen-
eral, with such information, by the Chapter President. The custo-
dian-General is required to return money paid for such Crosses.

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 381
RULES FOR CROSS OF SERVICE
RULES FOR THE AWARD OF THE CROSS OF SERVICE
THE WORLD WAR INSIGNIA OF THE UNITED
DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY
1. The United Daughters of the Confederacy as a testimonial
to the patriotic devotion and loyalty of the lineal male descendants
of the Confederate soldiers and sailors will bestow upon such de-
scendants as rendered honorable military or naval service to the
United States or its allies during the World War a decoration or
insignia to be known as the "Cross of Service," the awards to be
made under the conditions hereinafter set forth.
2. Any lineal descendant of a Confederate soldier or sailor,
who, subsequent to April 5, 1917, and prior to November 11, 1918,
served honorably in the Army, Navy or Marine Corps of the
United States, or as a member of the armed forces of its Allies,
shall be entitled to receive the award of the Cross of Service;
Provided he served at least ten days prior to November 11, 1918
and that his total service was at least ninety days; and provided
further, that he received an honorable discharge or has served
continuously since November 11, 1918 in the military or naval
service; and provided further, that no award shall be made to
any so-called "conscientious objector" even though he may have
received an honorable discharge.
3. Where the award of a Cross of Service is made to a person
who served overseas prior to November 11, 1918, there shall be
added as an additional mark of distinction a bronze dolphin, to
be placed on the ribbon by which the Cross is suspended., This
provision shall include those of the Navy or Marine Corps en-
gaged in the transport service in the belligerant zone.
4. No award shall be made except upon the request of a duly
chartered Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy, except
that the Executive Committee of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy, upon proper proof submitted to it of some special
service rendered, may vote the award of twc (2) Crosses of Ser-
vice for bestowal on the annual Historical Evening of the General
Convention United Daughters of the Confederacy and to such his-
torical societies and missions as the Executive Board may deem
entitled to such considerations.
5. Proof of Confederate service of ancestor or ancestors of
the one for whom the award of the Cross of Service is requested
may be accomplished by (a) by a report from the War or Navy
Department showing the facts with reference to such service,
or by accredited published documents, (b) by the certificate of


## p. 382 (#386) ############################################

382 THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION
two Confederate Veterans who had personal knowledge of the
honorable service of the said ancestor, (c) by a certificate issued
by the Office of a Probate Judge that the name of such ancestor
appears on the Pension Roll of said office, (d) by the certificate
from a duly chartered Camp of United Confederate Veterans, from
a similar Camp of Sons of Confederate Veterans, or from a Chapter
of the United Daughters of the Confederacy showing the estab-
lished Confederate service of such ancestor as appears on the rec-
ords of such Camp or Chapter. In short, whatever the method of
proof, the facts must be such that the ancestor, whether alive or
dead, must have served the Confederate States Government hon-
orably and faithfully, and was entitled, whether he did or not,
to have become a member, if the opportunity offered, of the United
Confederate Veterans.
6. Descent must be proved to the satisfaction of the Chapter,
when requesting that a Cross be awarded.
7. Honorable service in the World War may be established by
original certificate of discharge, of commission, or other official
papers in possession of the one to whom Cross is to be awarded
and shall be exhibited by the Chapter officer in charge of appli-
cations for Crosses; by reports from the War or Navy Depart-
ment or the official publication thereof, or by the certificate of a
Post of the American Legion, or similar organization showing
membership therein, provided such membership was obtained
through active service in the Army, Navy, Air or Marine Corps,
record being given of the beginning and termination of such ser-
vice, as disclosed by its records. All Chapters of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy are made the agent of the parent
organization in determining these facts and no Chapter officer
should sign the application for a Cross of Service until she has
been furnished with such officially required data. The application
should show positive evidence that the World War record of the
active service has been established to the satisfaction of the
chapter
8. The distribution of the Crosses of Service and the records
pertaining to the award, as well as all papers and records re-
lating thereto shall be under the supervision of the Custodian of
Crosses of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the
Recorder of Crosses of Divisions and Chapters, who shall carry
out the purposes and plans of the United Daughters or the Con-
federacy in the matter of the award of Crosses of Service to those
entitled under the rules to such award.
9. Crosses of Service may be awarded on the following days:
January 14th—birthday of Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury;

or navy.


## p. 383 (#387) ############################################

UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY 383
11. A Cross of Service should whenever possible be awarded
in person to the one for whom it is intended, but if, for some
unavoidable reason this is impossible, then the Cross may be
delivered to a legal representative. The occasion of the bestojwal
should be one of considerable ceremony, and where convenient,
the local Post or Posts of the American Legion should be invited
to participate in the honor done their comrades. The chapter
conferring the Cross may also invite other United Daughters of
the Confederacy Chapters to unite in the exercises of bestowal,
but the bestowal itself shall be made by one chapter, only.
12. Where a person who otherwise might be entitled to an
award of a Cross of Service, has died, the same may be conferred
upon his eldest child; if no child survives, then to his widow,
if there be one; if not then to his mother or father or to his
next nearest kin in the order named. No such person, nor any
other person, shall have the right at any time to wear the Cross,
thus bestowed.
13. The United Daughters of the Confederacy retains title in
a Cross so bestowed and should it be worn by anyone the matter
should be reported to the nearest local chapter which should at
once take up the Cross so illegally worn and return it to the
Custodian of Crosses, who will make a note against the record
of the person on account of whom such Cross was bestowed the
fact of its unauthorized use and that it was returned because of
this, and thereafter no further bestowal of the Cross shall be
made.
14. A Cross of Service bestowed on a living person shall be
worn by him only and is given with this understanding.
Respectfully submitted,
MRS. FRANK HARROLD,
MRS. L. B. REEVES,
