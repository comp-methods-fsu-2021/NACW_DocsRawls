18 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 Minutes of the LOuisville Convention do not fail to read your Presi- 
 dent General's report, giving especially the Chapters work accom- 
 plished by the division under the "War Relief Work Committee." 
 
 Your Registrar's report shows 331 new members registered in 
 North Carolina, with ten demitted to the State. This being the larg- 
 est new membership registered in the division during the year. 
 Two hundred and sixty-six certificates were issued by the Recording 
 Secretary General, of which number Mrs. Merchant said: "I con- 
 gratulate you on that goodly number, so many states have fallen 
 back this year, due to the war, I suppose." Three new Chapters 
 have been organized — one at Spring Hope by Mrs. Walter Woodard 
 — one at Asheville and one at Middlesex. 
 
 A motion at both the General and State Conventions of 1917 gave 
 our Veterans and Educational work only in conjunction with that of 
 the Great War. Twice during the month of January it was your 
 President's pleasure and honor to appear before the Legislature in 
 behalf of Increased Pensions for our dear old men. While we did 
 not obtain just as much as we most desired for them — and it seems 
 a pity too — for if North Carolina owes her Veterans anything it 
 owes them sufficient means that their last days may be passed in 
 ease and comfort. Still it is gratifying that our efforts were not 
 in vain as there was an increase on a basis of $15.00 for each grade. 
 Let us continue to work for Increased Pensions. Soon it will be 
 beyond the power of the State Legislature to aid these men that 
 dared all, sacrificed all and died — 
 
 "Their's not to reason why 
 Their's but to do and die." 
 
 There was an increased appropriation for the Soldier's Home and 
 the Confederate Women's Home; also the continued appropriation 
 for the next two years of $200 annually for the North Carolina Room 
 in the Museum in Richmond. With pride we are able to report the 
 first and only State to finish its endowment fund for this work. If 
 your President has accomplished nothing more during the time she 
 has served you this alone has been her reward; that twice during 
 her administration the Legislature has seen fit to listen to the plea 
 from the Daughters of the Confederacy for increased pensions for 
 the Confederate Veterans and their widows. It was in the power of 
 your representatives that the last days of the living of these heroes 
 should be more comfortable and they were not unmindful of them. 
 To Messrs. George Holderness of Tarboro and McCoin of Henderson 
 as Chairman of the Appropriations Committees your President sug- 
 gests that a resolution of thanks be sent by this division. 
 
 An endowment fund of $50,000, known as the Educational Endow- 
 ment Fund, has been established by the General Division. How you 
 have contributed to this fund, your educational chairman will report. 
 
## p. 19 (#23) 
United Daughters of the Confederacy 19  
 How much you are expected to contribute will be placed before you 
 by your Director of War Relief and your Educational Chairman. Do 
 not let this great opportunity pass to prepare plans for the boys and 
 girls of today to aid them in their life work in the future reconstruc- 
 tion days. The General Division has decided the endowment fund to 
 be a memorial to the men and women of the South who served in the 
 great World War, known by the name of "The 1917-1918 Hero Fund." 
 "To honor the men and women of the South who served their 
 reunited country." It was decided at the CJeneral Convention that 
 all funds in hand for War Relief Hospital Endowment Fund be 
 transferred to your Educational Endowment Fund. 
 
 All Chapters should encourage the organization of Children's 
 Chapters, also give their best interests to those already in existence. 
 For only in our children does our future lie. We must provide for 
 the education of the child of today, who will be the man of tomorrow. 
 As you look upon the flags and banners upon this rostrum, you will 
 notice that you won two of them at the General Convention at Chatta- 
 nooga last year, the Raines Banner for the best Historical Work, 
 and the Ricks Banner for the best Children's Work. Nor is this 
 all — you won both of these banners again this year at Louisville. 
 How your President's heart beat with joy and pride when she 
 accepted them again in your behalf; you have set the standard, see 
 that you do not lower it. 
 
 At the Gastonia Convention a resolution was passed "that the 
 U. D. C. suggest to the State Historical Commission the propriety of 
 the marking the places in the "Valley of Virginia, near Winchester, 
 where Generals Fettigrew and Ramseur died." Now this resolution 
 was carried out and will be shown you during this Convention, when 
 the two beautiful bronze tablets will be unveiled, the work jointly 
 of the Historical Commission and the North Carolina Divisi'^n cS. 
 the U. D. C. It is your happy privilege to see accomplished a lovely 
 and most fitting work begun by you last year, the painting of the 
 portrait of one of your best beloved Daughters, Mrs. Hunter Smith. 
 A token to her of your appreciation of her work, to be hung on the 
 walls made possible by the untiring interest and zeal, those of the 
 Confederate Women's Home. 
 
 The Hall of History will also be enriched this year by a portrait 
 of one of the Bethel Heroes, Gen. R. H. Ricks, who has done so much 
 for the true history of the War between the States. This portrait is 
 the gift to the State by the Junior Bethel Heroes Chapter of Rocky 
 Mount. 
 
 A pause and a moment of sorrow when the Jefferson Davis monu- 
 ment was accomplished and General Bennett H. Young answered 
 the last roll-call before he saw his greatest work finished. Daugh- 
 ters, we must not fail in carrying on this work, for will it not be 
 now a monument to both to stand forever as a tribute to our best

 Southern valor. One-half century (and more) has rolled away since 
 the bright star of the Confederacy "paled to a close." Although the 
 South was left in the stranded fragments of the great War between 
 the States, her honor was unsullied, and the Daughters of the Con- 
 federacy must see to it, more than ever before, that the names and 
 fame of their heroes shall never be forgotten. When they look upon 
 the faces of the remaining of their knightly chieftains, may they 
 realize that when these men sheathed their swords, the foundations 
 were laid anew for a Reunited Republic to loom up to horizon of this 
 earth to the admiration of all the world. 
 
 Your President would indeed be more than remiss should she not 
 attempt in her feeble way to thank you, to express to you how much 
 she appreciates your continued love, loyalty and support. In her 
 own words recorded in the Minutes of the Nineteen-Fifteen Conven- 
 tion, when she had the honor of being your Recording Secretary, 
 can she best express her feelings: "Her greatest gratification is in 
 thinking her work has given you satisfaction. Her reward — those 
 friends, true and tried, that she has found and held during the time 
 she has served you. Her only request that you give her successor 
 all the support that you have given her. Then indeed her work 
 will not have been in vain." 
 
 Do you realize what a wonderful work you have accomplished? 
 Listen to the result as reported in Louisville. You won the Raines 
 Banner for best Historical Work, and Ricks Banner for best Chil- 
 dren's Work during the past two years. No other state can claim 
 such honor. You registered the greatest number of new members. 
 Tied with South Carolina in Education honors. Had the best Relief 
 Work report. Was the only State that has completed its Endow- 
 ment Fund for Room in Richmond, and in every way won applause 
 for your splendid work. How feeble are words to express to you 
 your President's highest appreciation of your work and interest. To 
 the Executive Board she owes all gratitude for its support, wise 
 counselling and complete harmony in its decisions. The best of all 
 she adds is that during the dark days of your troubled land she has 
 given that satisfaction that not one word of dissension, one unpleas- 
 ant look has been hers from you. Her rulings during her entire 
 administration have been acquiesced so unhesitatingly when often it 
 meant sacrifice to you. Glorious to feel you have been "weighed 
 and not found wanting." 
 
 To the Veterans she must also extend her warmest appreciation. 
 In addition to words of praise and commendation from those whom 
 she has ever delighted to serve, they have proven their confidence in 
 her work by honoring her with their highest official gifts at their 
 Reunion in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Gen. James I. Metts, Commander of 
 the North Carolina Veterans having appointed her Matron of Honor 
 for the State and General Julian S. Carr, sponsor for the Army of 
 Northern Virginia of which he was commander.

  In conclusion, with a heart glowing full of love for you and pride 
 for the noble work in which you are engaged, your President lays 
 down the gavel. To you, her associates for so long, she cannot say 
 farewell, but in the language of the poet: 
 Life we've seen long together 
 Through pleasant and through cloudy weather 
 'Tis hard to part, when friends are dear 
 Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh or tear. 
 Then steal away. Give little warning 
 Choose thine own time, say not Good Night 
 But in some fairer, brighter clime 
 Bid me Good Morning. 
 Faithfully submitted, 
 Jacksie Daniel Thrash, 
 President N. C. Div. U. D. C. 
 
 Honorable mention was made by tbe President of the work 
 of Miss Annie Jean Gash, Chairman of Education, Miss Ameda 
 Moses of South Carolina and Mrs. K. P. Holt, Chairman of 
 Relief Work. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that Mrs. Thrash's report be 
 accepted and that she be given a rising vote of thanks for her 
 excellent report. 
 
 Miss Gary, the Recording Secretary, read her report. 
 
 RECORDING SECRETARY'S REPORT 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 Since those bright fall days of October, 1917, in Kinston (where 
 we last met), we have felt to the fullest the sorrows, sacrifices, and 
 glories of war and have known the thrill of its ending. We have 
 seen the grim pestilence of influenza stalk through our fair land, 
 laying low with its deadly touch many a dear one. Though the war 
 and pestilence, dear daughters, have brought you your full share of 
 sorrow and work, undaunted you have met the crisis. Worthy 
 daughters of worthy fathers and noble mothers, I glory in your 
 spirit and rejoice that I am one of you and feel an extra pride that 
 I should be one to serve you in a capacity to know how splendid 
 you are. 
 
 Seemingly, during 1917-1918 every ounce of time and energy was 
 expended upon war work of all kinds, and later upon nursing influ- 
 enza, still the work of the Division went steadily on. It is there- 
 fore with the greatest of pleasure I bring to you my report.

## p. 22 (#26)
22 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 Three new U. D. C. Chapters have been organized, the John W. 
 Bryant Chapter, Spring Hope; Fannie Patton Chapter, Asheville, 
 and the Nash Chapter, Middlesex, and two Children of the Confed- 
 eracy Chapters; the Junior Confederacy Chapter, Wilson, and Carrie 
 Leazer Chapter, Morrisville. 
 I have sent out 1,046 application blanks, signed, sealed and sent 
 to the proper source, 265 Children of Confederacy certificates. I have 
 mailed 285 letters, 335 cards and 97 circular letters, and have sent to 
 the several new chapters and a few officers, minute books of the 
 Kinston Convention. Owing to the increase of postage during the 
 war the proceeds from the application blanks were not sufficient to 
 cover the postage for this office, hence I had to call on the Treasurer 
 for the amount of $10.61 for postage. 
 Many letters have been received and I have at all times tried to 
 reply promptly and if I discovered that a Chapter's interest was 
 lagging I tried to spur it to new life and in cases of increased 
 interest in the cause by individuals and Chapters it has been a joy 
 to say a few more words to them to stimulate that interest. 
 With a heart full of love for the Cause of the Confederacy and for 
 you, dear sisters, in the work, I beg God's blessings upon us and 
 peace and happiness in the future. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 Nannie M. Gary. 
 
 Mrs. Little moved tliat the Secretary's report be accepted 
 with thanks. Carried.

 In a few words of appreciation of the work done by the 
 Treasurer, Miss Dfenson moved that the report be accepted. 
 
 Carried. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams made the following motion : 
 
 "I move that the money that has been carried for some years 
 as the Captain Smith Badge fund be transferred to the Hero 
 Education fund." 
 
 Seconded by Mrs. Marshall Williams. Carried. 
 
 Registrar's Report, owing to the absence of Mrs. McCullers, 
 was read by Miss Gary. 
 
 REGISTRAR'S REPORT 
 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy : 
 
 It gives me pleasure to present the following report for the 
 fiscal year now closing. In view of the fact that only half the 
 chapters sent in lists of members for comparison with the State

 With sincere appreciation of the consideration and courtesies ex- 
 tended me by my co-workers and trusting that my successor may be 
 a greater inspiration in the work this report is 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Mrs. Herbert McCuluers, 
 
 Registrar. 
 
 Mrs. Marshall Williams moved that the report be accepted, 
 and the Registrar be given a rising vote of thanks. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams moved that a telegram be sent to our 
 Registrar, Mrs. McCullers. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. H. A. London moved that messages be sent to Mrs. 
 Parsley, our Division Mother, and Mrs. Leo. Heartt. Carried. 
 
 Mrs. Thrash requested Miss Powell to send messages to the 
 following ladies :

 Mrs. Pender. 
 
 Recorder of Crosses report read by Mrs. R. L. Gwyn. 
 
 RECORDER OF CROSSES' REPORT. 
 Madam President and Daughters of the Confederacy: 
 
 Now that our soldier boys are returning home, many of them 
 decorated with the Cross of Honor, our thoughts turn back to our 
 own brave soldier boys of the Confederacy, who fought for four long 
 years, ill-clad and half fed, fighting and marching for days upon a 
 ration of parched corn. They also stood in muddy trenches, and 
 we realize more and more what they endured, and how brave and 
 self-sacrificing they were; soldiers never lived who could more 
 worthily wear the Cross of Honor. 
 
 During the year 1918 forty-two crosses have been bestowed in 
 our Division. Every letter received by your Recorder has been 
 promptly answered, in almost every instance by return mail. 
 
 There have been some disappointed Chapters because crosses were 
 not received on time, but this is because the applications were either 
 not sent in early enough, they must be in the Custodian General's 
 hands three weeks before the day of bestowal, others were not made 
 out correctly, several having been lost in the mail or express. I 
 deeply deplore these delays and disappointment.

 There is necessarily some "red tape" in securing the crosses, but 
 please remember the Recorder did not make the rules, but she must 
 abide by them! 
 
 I hope that during the coming year the descendants, whose parents 
 failed to receive their crosses, will make every effort to secure them.

 HISTORIAN'S REPORT. 
 
 The "Raines Banner" was presented to the North Carolina Divi- 
 sion last November for collecting and compiling more historical 
 records in 1917 than any other division. I was present at the Gen- 
 eral Convention and when I received the banner into my own hands 
 I do assure this body it was one of the proudest and happiest mo- 
 ments of my life. To feel that in serving my Division I was also 
 preserving to the State history which might otherwise have been 
 lost made me doubly happy. 
 
 This year the work of the Chapters has been curtailed very much 
 as the Daughters of the Confederacy have been busily engaged help- 
 ing our Government make history rather than following the peace- 
 ful pursuits of writing and collecting historical data. Still, I con- 
 sider they have responded to my circular letter, sent out early in 
 the year, in a wonderful manner and many unusually fine papers 
 have been sent to me, especially reminiscences by old ladies, who 
 have had many long forgotten events of the "60's" brought to their 
 recollection by the tremendous war drama of today. 
 
 The Contest for the "Raines Banner" is the only General Division 
 Contest our Division is competing for this year, 1918, because the 
 Reminiscence Prizes were discontinued and none of the Daughters 
 were inclined to write on the subject of "Southern Ideals" for the 
 Silver Loving Cup offered by the son of Mrs. S. E. F. Rose. How- 
 ever, in the North Carolina Division this year we have four contests 
 of our own, owing to the patriotism and generosity of four Daugh- 
 ters of the North Carolina Division.

44 Minutes of the Ttventy-second Annual Convention 
 
 1. Mrs. S. A. Kindley, of Gastonia, offers a handsome loving cup 
 in memory of her mother, to be presented each year to the Chapter 
 accomplishing the most historical work. 
 
 2. Mrs. Thomas Wilson, of Gastonia, offers for 1918 $10.00 in 
 gold to the Chapter that sends the best reminiscence from a woman 
 of the Confederacy. 
 
 3. Mrs. Caldwell Wilson, of Gastonia, offers for 1918 $10.00 in 
 gold to the Chapter sending the best reminiscence from a Veteran. 
 
 4. Mrs. T. W. Bickett offered through the J. J. Davis Chapter, 
 Louisburg, $20.00 in gold to the Veteran himself who writes the 
 best reminiscence. 
 
 When I realized my responsibility in deciding the merits of the 
 splendid papers sent me, I resolved to select the best in each class 
 and submit them to a competent critic to choose the winning paper. 
 Judge Walter Clark kindly consented to undertake the task for the 
 Veterans and Miss Cordelia Phifer, a former State Historian of 
 the D. A. R. for the women's reminiscences. I asked Judge Clark 
 to write his choice in each of the Veterans' Contests and place in 
 an envelope and seal it, the seal not to be broken until Historical 
 evening. I followed the same procedure with the Wilson prize for 
 the best woman's reminiscence — Miss Phifer sealing her choice also. 
 These will be opened in your presence historical evening. 
 
 The three papers by living veterans, selected as best of those sent 
 to Historian in 1918 are — one by Capt. Waddell, sent by Asheville 
 Chapter. 
 
 One by Mr. Edmund Jones, of Lenoir, sent by John Dunham 
 Chapter. 
 
 One by Col. E. A. Osborne, of Charlotte, sent by Stonewall Jack- 
 son Chapter. 
 
 The prize of $20.00 in gold will be given to veteran, whose paper 
 is awarded the prize by Judge Walter Clark. 
 
 Equally good papers were sent to Historian contesting for prize 
 offered by Mrs. Caldwell Wilson of $10.00 in gold to Chapter sending 
 in the best reminiscence by veteran, living or dead. Those selected 
 as the best are: 
 
 One by Rev. J. B. Whitaker (deceased) sent by Johnston-Pettigrew 
 Chapter, Raleigh. 
 
 lOne by Mr. Erel sent by Johnston-Pettigrew Chapter. Raleigh. 
 
 One by Mr. Ledbetter (deceased) sent by Gastonia Chapter, 
 Gastonia. 
 
 Judge Clark will also award the Wilson prize for the finest of 
 these three reminiscences. 
 
 The women's reminiscences were so many and so fine that it was 
 exceedingly difficult to make a just selection. It was almost im- 
 possible to discriminate between four superb papers. These are: 
 
 A Reminiscence by "Little Reb" (nom de plume) sent by John W. 
 Dunham Chapter. 
 
 One by Rachel Pearsall sent by Gastonia Chapter. 
 
 One by Mrs. Ida Wilkins, President Junius Daniel Chapter, 
 Weldon. 
 
 One by Mrs. William Howard of W. Dorsey Pender Chapter, Tar- 
 boro. 
 
 Miss Phifer placed her award in sealed envelope to be opened 
 Historical Evening. 
 
 The Chapter Contest for which Mrs. S. A. Kindley offers a silver 
 loving cup will be decided by the data written on the Chapter Re- 
 ports and not by me. The Chapters doing the best historical work 
 are Asheville, Fayetteville, Mrs. J. H. Anderson, historian; Gastonia,

United Daughters of the Confederacy 45 
 
 Mrs. Thomas Wilson historian; Raleigh, Mrs. S. J. Ellis historian, 
 and Wilson, Mrs. H. G. Connor, historian. May I suggest that any 
 one of these able women would make a fine State Historian. Mrs. 
 Gudger, President of the Asheville Chapter, managed the historical 
 department as well as presided over the affairs of her Chapter. 
 I have not yet placed the papers of 1917 in the Hall of History. It 
 seems to me the best of the papers of both 1917 and 1918 should be 
 published in some form for the benefit of the present generation 
 before putting them where they will only be accessible to searchers 
 of historical records. I hope the convention will consider this 
 matter. 
 
 The reading of so many papers of thousands of pages, though 
 the contents is intensely interesting, is a laborious task. These 
 papers have to be filed, the Chapters and persons given credit 
 and acknowledgment when possible. The best are read over 
 many times so as to judge their merits for the ^'Contests" and 
 one can imagine the nervous strain this part of the work 
 entails. 
 
 Getting out the Eeport on the "Raines Banner" Contest 
 means a circular letter sent to Chapters asking for account of 
 all phases of historical work and blanks for same to be filed; 
 filing and comparing these, besides incorporating the Report 
 of the Education and Scrap Book Chairman and oh any out- 
 standing historical work in the State generally. 
 
 That the "Raines Banner" was won again in 1918 for the 
 second consecutive year is a splendid reward to your Historian 
 and the Chapter historians who have so faithfully cooperated 
 in the work. 
 
 Daughters of the North Carolina Division, I feel that you 
 have greatly honored me in making me your Historian during 
 the past two years, for the work, though onerous, has been 
 a labor of love. I thank you for your consideration and the 
 beautiful letters of appreciation many of you have written.

 The children's work is a very important one, they are the founda- 
 tion on which the U. D. C. work is to be carried on in years to come. 
 The children of today are the daughters of tomorrow, and it is 
 through them that our work will continue to live. 
 
 I am disappointed not to report every chapter in the State regis- 
 tered, I had hoped to accomplish that this year. 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 (Mrs. L. T.) Isabelle T. Townsend, 
 Director of Children, N. C. Div., U. D. C. 
 
 Mrs. Hunter Smith moved that the report be accepted and 
 that Mrs. Townsend be given a rising vote of thanks. 
 
 Report of the Executive Committee was read by Miss Gary, 
 the Recording Secretary, and acted upon separately. 
 
 REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 
 
 The Executive Committee of the North Carolina Division, United 
 Daughters of the Confederacy, met with Mrs. Walter F. Woodward 
 at the Country Club at 2 o'clock, April 29, 1919. 
 
 The Committee was called to order by the President, Mrs. Thrash. 
 Nine members reported present. Business was immediately taken 
 up. During the hour of meeting Mrs. Thrash expressed the great 
 pleasure felt by the Committee at having present Miss Mary B. 
 Poppenheim, the President General. High tributes were paid to 
 Miss Poppenheim, to Mrs. Thrash and the Board. 
 
 The following recommendations of the President were read 
 and approved by the Executive Board : 
 
 Recommendation I. — Under rule for registration, all applications 
 must be signed by the applicant herself. No exception to this rule 
 can be made by either the State Registrar or President of a Chapter. 
 
 Moved by Mrs. Marshall Williams that it be accepted. 
 Seconded by Mrs. F. R. "Williams. Adopted. 
 
 Recommendation II. — Application blanks of old members, never 
 registered before, should bear the date of the year they joined and 
 signed by the then President and Secretary. Let their new papers 
 be marked "duplicate, original lost." The Credental Committee 
 named at that time omitted. By no means register as joining at 
 the present time. 
 
 A discussion followed as to the feasibility of having these 
 blanks signed by the President and Recording Secretary of the 
 Chapter, who were in office at the time that applicant joined. 
 One of the memibers of the Executive Committee called the 
 attention of the Convention that the words "if possible" should 
 have been recorded in the recommendation.

 There followed a discussion as to the proper procedure in

 REPORT OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. 
 
 NORTH CAROLINA DIVISION, UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE 
 
 CONFEDERACY. 
 
 Madam President, and Fellow Members of the Division: 
 
 For the fourth year I bring you a summary of our work in Educa- 
 tion. Two requests, blanks to be filled out, have been mailed to 
 each chapter, asking for a detailed and itemized account of all 
 educational work done. One set I mailed myself last fall, one set 
 together with a statement from Miss Moses about the General En- 
 dowment and 1917-1918 Hero Fund, Miss Gary sent out with this 
 convention call. 
 
 From our ninety-nine chapters forty-nine replies were received, 
 showing a total of 35 Division, District and Chapter Scholarships, 
 valued at $2,132.00. 
 
 The reports of money contributed to our Division Scholarship 
 Fund are so incomplete and so confused with contributions to 
 the General Education Endowment Fund that my figures do not 
 at all agree with the amounts your Treasurer has handled. How- 
 ever, I am expecting such a glare of explanation and such a gale 
 of enthusiasm for this 1917-1918 Hero Fund at this convention 
 from our War Relief Committee and from our President General, 
 that there will not be one confusing cobweb of misunderstanding 
 left in any single chapter. 
 
 Our Normal Scholarships, which we must now learn to call our 
 Division Scholarships at the North Carolina College for Women, 
 are the most in demand of anything we have to offer, and should 
 be supported by every chapter, 10 cents per member would easily 
 pay the $450.00 which the Division pledges to this cause. The 
 R. E. Lee Chapter, Lexington, and the James B. Gordon Chapter, 
 Winston-Salem, each supports their own scholar at Greensboro, the 
 North Carolina College, and the Thirteenth District set a good 
 (luck) example by giving a $50.00 Liberty Bond to this Division 
 Fund.

 The Elvira Worth Moffltt Loan Fund kept up two scholarships 
 this year, the interest paying one and the payment of last year's 
 loan the other. 
 
 Your committee labored strenuously to fill all Division scholar- 
 ships, but six remained unused from lack of help from nearby chap- 
 ters, and because some assistance besides tuition is needed by most 
 applicants. One of the scholarships awarded to this State by the 
 General Education Committee, that at St. Mary's School, Memphis, 
 had to be given up because the applicant could not meet the other 
 expenses. But besides this our State used five of the most valuable 
 general scholarships: Vassar (where our Alice Sawyer has just 
 graduated with honor), Lucy Cobb, the University of Virginia, and 
 the University of North Carolina. Very few applications are on file 
 for this year, I regret to admit, so please do some advertising! 
 
 As to the other branches of work classed as educational, 6 medals, 
 worth $26.00 and 5 prizes, worth $23.00, have been given for essays 
 on subjects of Confederate interest. Eleven portraits of generals 
 have been presented to schools at a cost of $45.00. Three chapters 
 support and run the libraries of their respective towns and as many 
 more conduct the Lyceum Courses. Thirteen chapters report books 
 given to soldiers, 1,300 volumes valued at over $800.00. 
 
 In the aggregate, our educational achievements of the past year 
 make a better showing than might have been expected, but they 
 would be twice as good if every chapter told all they did and if the 
 slack teams picked up their share of the load. Now that the war 
 is over, let us "go over the top" in education, just as we have done 
 in war relief!

 Mrs. H. A. London moved that the report be accepted. 
 Seconded and carried. 
 
 Mrs. Little spoke of the arduous work connected with the

 Mrs. Moffitt made report of the Elvira Worth Moffitt Schol- 
 arship. 
 
 REPORT OF ELVIRA WORTH MOFFITT SCHOLARSHIP. 
 
 For twelve years a Memorial Fund was being collected from the 
 chapters for erecting a memorial gate to the Confederate Cemetery 
 of Raleigh, N. C, in commemoration of the one thousand dead who 
 lie buried there from all thirteen Southern States. At the end of 
 twelve years, the Confederate Memorial Association decided we 
 could not erect this gate, for the reason it necessitated the taking 
 up of fifteen graves. At a convention held several years ago the 
 fund was voted to go into the Educational Fund. The association 
 voted that it be named the Elvira Worth Moffitt Loan Fund, and

 used at the Normal to educate girls who are descendants of Con- 
 federate Veterans. Mrs. Moffitt's nieces and nephews subscribed 
 the necessary amount to make up the sum of $1,500.00 for the loan 
 every year at the Normal School, North Carolina. 
 
 Accepted. 
 
 The War Relief Work report was made by its enthusiastic 
 and efficient Director, Mrs. R. P. Holt, of Rocky Mount. 
 
 REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF WAR RELIEF WORK. 
 
 Madam President General, President North Carolina Division, 
 Daughters, Friends: 
 
 As Director of War Relief Work in our Division. I greet you and 
 bring you your report,- — one that should be very different, for I 
 know you all are at work and as loyal as any set of women, but so 
 few chapters have sent in their reports, and many of those sent 
 were only filled out in part. 
 
 I realize that I haven't been able to do all that I should have 
 done during the past eighteen months, but circumstances were 
 such that I could do no more. I want to thank our President for 
 allowing me the privilege of doing this work, for it has been a 
 pleasure and a blessing to me. 
 
 I have sent out eight hundred and twenty (820) circular letters; 
 written two hundred and eighteen (218) letters; three hundred and 
 eighty (380) postals; sent notices of our work to seventy-five (75) 
 papers in the State; kept in constant touch with Mrs. Rountree, 
 Chairman of our Central Committee. As our President said in her 
 message, we have furnished the following beds: 
 
 1. Zebulon Baird Vance — In Honor of the War Governor of North 
 Carolina — ready February 25, 1918. 
 
 2. In Memoriam — The North Carolina Heroes — 1861-1865 — ready 
 in March, 1918. 
 
 Both of these beds were given by our Division. The following

 The $1,200.00 paid for our two beds and $100.00 was sent towards 
 the bed to Southern Women, of 1861-1865. Then $5.35 to the gen- 
 eral bed to the private soldiers of the Confederacy. 
 
 3. The Rocky Mount Bed — In honor of the Boys of Nash and 
 Edgecombe Counties — By the Junior Bethel Heroes Children of Con- 
 federacy. Ready June 10, 1918. 
 
 4. The Wayne County Bed — In honor the Wayne County Soldiers, 
 by Thos. Ruffin Chapter, Goldsboro, N. C. Ready in July, 1918. 
 
 I have sent two boxes to our beds in the hospital at Neuilly, 
 France; six Sambos from The Margaret Davis Hayes Chapter, Hen- 
 dersonville; a beautiful knitted comfort, with large Confederate flag 
 knit in the center, from the Guilford Chapter, Greensboro, which was 
 used on the Zebulon Baird Vance bed. 
 
 Another knitted comfort with the Stars and Stripes knit in one 
 corner, from the Mount Airy Chapter, which was being used on our 
 Bed in Honor of the North Carolina Heroes of '61-'65. 
 
 In the same box a large knitted comfort in gray with large red 
 cross in center — knit by the boys and girls of the tenth grade in 
 the Rocky Mount high school, and sent through the Junior Bethel 
 Heroes Children of Confederacy, which was used on the Rocky Mount 
 bed. Also for that bed, 12 linen pillow cases, 12 linen sheets, 3 
 Sambos, subscriptions to four magazines, 100 post cards, and book- 
 lets, about Rocky Mount, sent by the Junior Bethel Heroes. Sent to 
 Camp Jackson four comforts from the Margaret Davis Hayes Chap- 
 ter, Hendersonville. 
 
 Through your director, one lot of two hundred (200) pairs of 
 socks have been sent to a Y. M. C. A. secretary for use in France. 
 The Junior Bethel Heroes Children of Confederacy, giving one hun- 
 dred (100) of them, the others being given by individuals; also 
 1,240 pairs of socks to the 120th Infantry given by the Junior Bethel 
 Heroes Children of Confederacy. A beautiful knitted comfort knit 
 by eight little girls of the Confederacy of Bdenton, to be used on 
 one of the North Carolina beds. The children are interested in this 
 work and are only waiting for their leaders to suggest and work 
 with them. 
 
 They have raised $225.30 towards the Henry L. Wyatt bed, the 
 following chapters contributing:

 But as the beds were discontinued the funds went to support six

 Odette Bernard (Girl). Address: 48 rue de Paris, Petit Ivry, 
 Seine. France. Date of birth: September 22, 1908. 
 
 Estelle Bernard (Girl). Address: 48 rue de Paris, Petit Ivry, 
 Seine, France. Date of birth: July 18, 1910. 
 
 Madeline Dubin (Girl). Address: 67 rue d'Avron, Paris 20 
 Arrondissement, France. Date of birth: January 26, 1908. 
 
 Antoinette Bernard (Girl). Address: 27 rue de Verneuil, Paris 
 7 Arrondissement, France. Date of birth: April 4, 1914. 
 
 Louise Dessenne (Girl). Address: Ferme de Montrambourge, 
 Vierzy, Aisne, France. Date of birth: October 2, 1912. 
 
 Marcelle Dessenne (Girl). Address: Ferme de Montrambourge, 
 Vierzy, Aisne, France. Date of birth: April 6, 1914. 
 
 Very few of the Chapters have sent in the lists of lineal 
 descendants. Daughters, if your Central Committee had not 
 known this was important, do you think they would have asked 
 every organized Chapter of the U. D. C. to get these records? 
 Indiana won the $20.00 in gold offered the State for the largest 
 list. Can't we win in JSTovemher? 
 
 We realize it takes time and work, but if our boys can give 
 their all, can't we at least do our part to keep their records 
 straight ? Think, in years to come, what it will mean to them, 
 and their children. With all the work the Wilson Chapter had, 
 they sent in a list of three hundred (300). Daughters, it is 
 too late now to help your State to win The Youree Prize for 
 


## p. 56 (#60) ##############################################

56 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 the past year, but it isn't too late to get our State records and 
 win in November, 1919 ; so please eacb Daughter feel that it is 
 her business to help get these records. 
 
 The first of the year I sent a list of questions to each Chap- 
 ter and asked for a monthly report, but only a few noticed them 
 at all. If they had been answered each month our report would 
 have been so much better and not near the trouble to you. As 
 it is' only 45 Chapters, and 12 Children's Chapters, have 
 responded to the Central Committee's request for these blanks 
 to be filled out and returned. 
 
 One Chapter PresidcJnt writes as follows : "It seems that this 
 is all so needless, I think the one that had these questions sent 
 out ought to realize that Chapters like ours could not give time 
 to answering such questions. Not one of our members is will- 
 ing to undertake the getting up of the records." The D. A. R.'s 
 are reporting their work, therefore we don't want to report 
 twice." 
 
 Now Daughters, don't you think you owe it to your heroic 
 ancestors, your State and your Division, to do all you can 
 to keep the records and show to the world that our women 
 and our boys are as loyal and true as those of any other State. 
 Now please send me a report of all work you have done that was 
 not reported to me last year, for we want to complete our work 
 by November. 
 
 Daughters, all money left from our beds has gone into what is 
 known as the "1917-18 Heroes Educational Fund." Now each 
 State that raises $1,S 50.00, sent through its War Relief Director, 
 will be entitled to one of these scholarships in its own University, 
 and can name it whatever they prefer. Knowing your loyalty, 
 I pledged North Carolina would raise the required amount, and 
 up to date we have $549.87. Won't you now pledge the other 
 to be paid by June 15, 1919? 
 
 Respectfully submitted, 
 
 Tempe Whitehead Holt, 
 Director War Belief Work.

 Mrs. Little, being recognized, asked for information regarding 
 recording the names of women who have sei*\'ed their country 
 during this war who were descendants of Veterans. 
 
 Miss Poppenheim, the President General, stated that no 
 provision had been made for recording these names as yet, but 
 probably later some provision would be made for this. Mrs.

60 Minutes of the Twenty-second Annual Convention 
 
 Holt stated that a list of fifteen names were sent in to Mrs. 
 Beale, and that Mrs. Little's daughter was one of those named. 
 
 The President then asked the President General to give 
 some information as to the Hero 1917-1918 Fund and Educa- 
 tion Fund. 
 
 Miss Poppenheim stated that at the Louisville Convention 
 a motion was. made which provided that all money in hands of 
 the State Treasurer for the henefit of endowing beds in hospitals 
 in N'ueilly, France, should be transferred to the Hero Fund, 
 as these beds are no longer needed. 
 
 Mrs. Holt asked Miss Poppenheim if North Carolina could 
 transfer the sum of $500.00 pledged under the Endowment Fund 
 and place it as an Educational Endowment Fund to one of the 
 scholarships in North Carolina. Miss Poppenheim said it was 
 with North Carolina to say what she would do with her money. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams asked if it would be used as a scholar- 
 ship dedicated in memory of any one particular person. Mrs. 
 Holt said it would be a scholarship used as a memorial to all of 
 the boys who served. 
 
 After the discussion, Mrs. Loudon moved "that we accept 
 Mrs. Holt's report." Accepted with thanks. 
 
 After some discussion as to raising the fund for the scholar- 
 ship, the Director was asked Avhat amount she had on hand to 
 be applied for this purpose. She reported $549.87 already 
 raised towards the 1,250. 
 
 The President stated that of the $500.00 pledged by her at 
 Louisville for the Educational Endowment $310.00 is to be raised 
 by the Division, the balance having been pledged. 
 
 Mrs. F. M. Williams asked that the Treasurer be consulted 
 and the $310.00 be paid from the funds. After discussion 
 pledges were given from the floor. 
 
 The following amounts were pledged by Chapters and indi- 
 viduals :

 REPORT OF THE CONFEDERATE WOMEN'S HOME. 
 Madam President and Daughters : 
 
 At no time in the world's history has there been a crisis when 
 woman has not been called upon for service, and at no time has 
 woman failed in her duty. Women are the sentiment makers of 
 the world. Wherever women are, sacrifice is. 
 
 And this year, with its many demands, has been no exception. 
 For your same loyalty for the descendants of the men of the '60's 
 who surrendered their lives in the great struggle for human free- 
 dom, in some respects surpasses last year's report.

64 Minutes of the Twenty -second Annual Convention 
 
 I am very glad to report the Home in good condition, and run- 
 ning smoothly. Our Superintendent, Miss Watters, has proved very 
 faithful and acceptable. And while there have come to us some 
 sorrows, during the year, many joys have been given the ladies. The 
 Fayetteville Chapter has been very considerate of their pleasure. 
 Through the efforts of our former President, Mrs. Bidgood, and our 
 present President, Mrs. Hall, afternoon teas and other entertain- 
 ments have been provided, which have been much enjoyed. The 
 Christmases of 1917 and 1918 were celebrated in a most festive 
 manner, a Christmas tree being filled with remembrances for all the 
 ladies, a beautiful Colonial entertainment was given through the 
 efforts of Miss Matthews, and a most generous donation of a beauti- 
 ful new Kimball piano by Mr. W. F. Blount, which filled a long felt 
 want. Chautauqua tickets and tickets to the County Fair are always 
 provided for those able to attend. 
 
 Our ladies have been much interested in Red Cross work and our 
 entire household joined the Red Cross, and were among the first 
 to offer their services for work. They have made more than 100 
 fracture and comfort pillows, knitted 100 pairs of socks and done 
 other Red Cross work, and enjoyed doing it. 
 
 Several nice piazzas have added to the comfort of the exterior of 
 the Home. The rooms in the Thrash Annex have been furnished 
 by Greensboro, Wilson and Durham Chapters, and by Mrs. Patterson 
 of Greensboro, and Mrs. Thomas of Charlotte. The checks and 
 boxes sent during the year have been much appreciated and added 
 much in a substantial way. We feel that the chapters that have 
 remembered the Home so liberally this year, amid the many other 
 calls and duties deserve our deepest thanks, and will be "thrice 
 blessed." 
 
 We feel very much the necessity of an increased appropriation 
 for maintenance, and regret very much that the General Assembly 
 did not give us an increased appropriation. We have been assured, 
 however, that we would be given an increase at the special session 
 that is to be called. We also need more downstairs room, as many 
 cannot be admitted on account of not being able to go upstairs. 
 A nurse will be needed permanently, as our family grows more 
 infirm each day and need more attention. Five thousand dollars a 
 year, the present appropriation, you can readily see, with the high 
 cost of living, is not sufficient to meet all the needs of the institution. 
 Let me urge every lady present to see her representative in person 
 and secure his support for an increased appropriation at the meet- 
 ing of the next Legislature. 
 
 We request that the Chapters that have not yet replenished their 
 respective rooms with bed linen, bureau scarfs and curtains send 
 them in as soon as possible. Gray gingham suitable for dresses 
 and aprons, and bleaching for underclothes would be most acceptable. 
 
 There have been admitted into the home since our last meeting, 
 twelve. The Reaper has called up higher seven of our family: 
 Mrs. Worth, Mrs. Loftin, Mrs. Chestnut, Mrs. Lewie, Mrs. Lee, Mrs. 
 Charles and Miss Clark. 
 
 The Home has filled its mission, a long felt need in North Caro- 
 lina, and the expressions that come to us and the continued loyalty 
 of the chapters is most gratifying. Expressions like these from our 
 ladies: "Didn't know I ever could be so happy again in this life" 
 make us feel repaid for the effort on the part of all, for those less 
 fortunate. 
 
 We feel that we have been most fortunate in securing the services 
 of Miss Williams as assistant to Miss Watters, to look after the in- 
 firm. She is gentle and kind, and a great comfort to the dependent.

 My hands have been very full this year, but the Confederate 
 Home, and our dear old ladies come next to my own home. I have 
 been chairman of and on seven different committees on war activ- 
 ities, and have given my two boys as volunteers to the service of 
 their country. And if I haven't answered all your letters as 
 promptly as usual, I feel you will pardon me, with such an anxious 
 heart. But now we feel that the silver lining is not far distant, 
 and with the hope that the war clouds may ever be dispelled, we 
 can promise more faithful service for the coming year.
